While the oil-filled dome solved the O-ring flooding failures, it introduced beam defocusing in two conditions, warm & shallow and cold & deep. Our engineers solved this problem by designing a patented acoustic lens that maintains beam focus through operational temperature and depth changes, significantly improving sonar performance and resulting in images that are much sharper. Clariscan is currently available in a 4000M depth-rated version. Applications: Clariscan is suitable for obstacle avoidance, pipeline survey, target detection, and underwater construction support. Data Comparison: Deep water testing in the Gulf of Mexico clearly showed the difference in image quality between the Clariscan sonar head and the standard domed sonar with composite transducer.",Key Features: - Patented acoustic lens design - Maintains beam focus through operational temperature and depth changes - Significantly improves sonar performance - Available in a 4000M depth-rated version,I don't know,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/marine-robotics/underwater-vehicle-instruments/single-beam-scanning-sonars/domed-scanning-sonar/,,"{'Application note': ['https://www.kongsberg.com/globalassets/maritime/km-products/product-documents/low-cost-search-amp-recovery-scanning-sonar-system/'], 'Brochure': [], 'Related publications': ['https://www.mesotech.online/domed_sonar/documents.htm'], 'Software Download': [], 'Downloads': ['https://www.kongsberg.com//maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/sonars/sonars-for-marine-site-inspection/DAS/']}",,,"{""error"": ""Incomplete technical specifications provided.

59,59,59,59,59,59,59,Dual Axis Scanning Sonar ,"Underwater navigation & positioning, Communication solutions","The Dual-Axis Scanning (DAS) Sonar is a profiling system designed for long-term seabed or structure monitoring. This scanning sonar works with both the MS1000 software program or in offshore wind “standalone mode” where the data is logged in the head and transmitted to shore via cable or wireless telemetry. The continuous 3D-surveying capability of the DAS provides crucial information on the dynamics of sediment scour and aggregation, and its rugged design is ideal for deployment on structures in high-current or harsh offshore environments. The DAS outputs an X, Y, Z serial data string of profile points that can be processed by many digital terrain modeling software packages including Kongsberg VistaGround and EIVA NaviSuite Edulis (specific to scour monitoring). The sonar head is designed primarily for pole-mount deployment and can be used in standalone mode or with the MS1000 processing software on a PC. A single or multiple heads can be integrated into a system to monitor a large area. The sonar can operate in standalone mode using pre-defined configurations and interface with other third-party equipment installed in remote locations. Alternatively, in MS1000 Mode, the processing software operates the sonar with data visualization on screen and recorded for further processing, with all MS1000 Standard Edition capabilities enabled.","• Designed for long-term deployment in harsh conditions

70,70,70,70,70,70,70,EM 2040 PHS Portable Hydrographic System ,Underwater navigation & positioning,"The power output level of an echo sounder is normally specified by giving its source level in dB relative to 1 μPa at a distance of 1 m from the transmit transducer. However, this is really a measure of the pressure level of the output sound wave and is only directly applicable in the farfield. The intensity (power per unit area) of a sound wave can be found from the pressure level by the relation I = p2/ρc where ρ is the water density and c the speed of sound. The quantity ρc is the acoustic impedance of water and for sea water is nominally taken to be 1.5x106 kg/m2s. Thus, a pressure level in sea water of 1 μPa is nominally equal to an energy intensity of 0.667x10-18 W/m2, and a pressure level of for example 210 dB corresponds to an intensity of 667 W/m2. In the farfield the pressure level of a sound wave will fall off with the square of the distance, this because of spherical spreading of the wave, and the wave will be further attenuated due to absorption loss. In the next table the pressure levels at a set of fixed distances are given and also the range at which the pressure level is 180 dB re 1 μPa. Note that the figures are worst case, i.e. on-axis and with no defocusing.

It is an ideal tool for any high resolution mapping and inspection application. With the release of the EM 2040 MKII series Kongsberg Maritime has upgraded the hardware and software to increase the swath and improve the data quality of our EM 2040 series. The system fulfils, and even surpasses, IHO-S44 Exclusive with one sonar head, allowing coverage of 5.5 times water depth. For a dual transducer system, 200° angular coverage or 10 times the water depth is achieved on a flat bottom. The operating frequency range is from 200 to 400 kHz with frequency selection in steps of 10 kHz. The operator can on the fly choose the best operating frequency for the application: 300 kHz for near bottom, 200 kHz for deeper waters and 400 or 700 kHz for very high resolution inspection. By alternating between the frequency modes per ping, the system is capable of providing the operator with Multi Frequency Backscatter of up to 5 frequencies in a single pass. The same functionality allows the system to alternate between a full swath mode and a high resolution mode providing full coverage while maintaining ultra high resolution over a target. The maximum depth range for a dual head system in cold ocean water is 520 m at 200 kHz with a swath width up to 700 m. Due to the large operating bandwidth, the system has an output sample rate up to 60 kHz. The system can effectively operate with very short pulse lengths. The shortest pulse is 14 microseconds, which gives a raw range resolution (ct/2) of 10.5 mm. The EM 2040C is also available in a 1500m depth rated version with a 130° swath for ROV or AUV operations.","  - 200-400 kHz wide frequency range

The system operates in SSBL mode where it measures the distance and direction to subsea transponders and computes a 3D position in local coordinates or in geographical coordinates. HiPAP 352P is designed to be a portable system for easy installation on surface vessels or other surface units. APOS, the operator station for HiPAP 352P, provides the full range of functions for acoustic positioning and data communication. HiPAP 352P benefits from the Cymbal acoustic protocol and all functions that are available for the HiPAP products are also available for HiPAP 352P. HiPAP 352P has full LBL calibration and positioning capabilities and can be used for position box in, calibration and positioning. The system is offering the user a wide range of transponder channels and cNODE transponder models for depths down to 4000 meters. HiPAP 352P has built-in motion sensors for compensating the position for vessels roll and pitch movements. These models have no need for calibration of roll and pitch alignments but need to calibrate for alignment to the vessels’ gyro compass. The system can be interfaced to the vessel heading sensor and GNSS system. Data output to users are available in established formats. The HiPAP 352P-MGC contains a motion sensor and a gyro compass. This model has no need for calibration to determine roll, pitch and heading alignments.

124,124,124,124,124,124,124,MGC Maintenance & Recalibration,"Inertial solutions, ","MGC maintenance & recalibration When to service the MGC The MGC (Motion Sensor & Gyro Compass) is maintenance free when operated as an IMO type approved gyro compass and no field maintenance is required. However, if the MGC is used as a roll and pitch sensor in addition to being a heading device, the need for a recalibration of the MGC should be considered. This is based on the use and operation mode of the sensor unit. Recalibration The table shows an estimate of the total static attitude accuracy over time. The ”L” in the table is the latitude. The need for recalibration of the MGC sensor unit depends on the application and the operation mode which the unit has been set up to operate in. AHRS modeIn this mode input of speed and latitude is required to obtain full accuracy. For speed input NMEA VTG or VBW can be used. For position input NMEA GLL or GGA can be used. External time input, NMEA ZDA, is also required to correctly time tag alerts from the gyro compass. In this mode the sensor unit will output accurate heading, roll, pitch and heave. The accuracy is within the specifications. This is the default mode for the sensor unit. Inertial navigation modeIn this mode input of latitude, longitude, height and time from a GNSS receiver, is required. Input of NMEA VTG, GGA and ZDA at 1 Hz rate is required. This mode requires that the MGC is time synchronized with the external input source by a PPS signal from the GNSS receiver or by using an NTP server. In this mode the sensor unit will output accurate heading, roll, pitch, heave, position and velocity. The accuracy is within the specifications. No recalibration is necessary if the sensor unit is operated in inertial navigation mode. When operating in inertial navigation mode, the sensor unit will calculate the drift in the accelerometers over time and correct for its influence. If the sensor unit is not operated in inertial navigation mode, the accelerometer bias drift is not calculated. This will mainly result in a possible static roll/pitch error. The heading accuracy will not be significantly affected, except at high latitudes. VALIDITY OF MGC CALIBRATION CERTIFICATE An individual Calibration Certificate is generated for each manufactured MGC. The certificate confirms performance for the MGC compared with test requirements valid for the specific type of MGC. The calibration date is printed on the Calibration Certificate. The certificate does not include an expiry date as the MGC will still be working even if there has been a long time since the last calibration. However, the uncertainty whether the MGC is within its specifications, will increase over the years without a recalibration. A recalibration of the MGC is recommended due to changes in the characteristics of the internal sensors over time, and is therefore necessary in order to achieve the specified performance. Exactly when a recalibration is required, will depend on the user application (use of the unit, i.e. thermal cycling, vibration and shock). MGC dispatch procedure If a recalibration of an MGC is required, please follow these steps to ensure an efficient and smooth recalibration process: Contact the Customer Support departement at Kongsberg Discovery by phone to +47 33 03 24 07 or by e-mail to km.support.seatex@km.kongsberg.com and ask for an RMA (Return Material Authorization). If you need a spare MGC during recalibration, please ask for a quote. You will receive an RMA number. Please attach the RMA to the MGC shipment. MGC recalibration turnaround time In general, the turnaround time for a complete service of MGC units are four weeks after reception. Within five days after the arrival of an MGC, the unit has gone through an initial inspection. The calibration may uncover the need for service that does not appear during static testing on arrival and thus delays should be expected. The unit must then undergo service followed by a new calibration cycle. The delivery time will be extended accordingly.

As a school of fish changes shape and density constantly, the MS70 is the best possible tool to understand these dynamics with remote sensing. The MS70 was the world's first quantitative multibeam sonar for fishery research applications. The MS70 operates in the frequency range of 70 to 120 kHz using 800 transmitting and receiving channels. The transducer is mounted on a drop keel, which allows it to look horizontally. Advanced beamforming software is used to form 500 beams, these are spread out 60° horizontally by 45° vertically. The MS70 Multibeam scientific sonar is designed for high operating flexibility. It provides an acoustic matrix of stabilized and calibrated beams for biomass estimation, fish school characterization and behaviour studies. Within the bandwidth of the transducer, the limits for beam steering, and the minimum achievable beam opening, you can select the directions, frequencies, and opening angles for the beams. You can set up the system to fit your requirements, and it will provide you with a real-time display for quality control of the current data acquisition. The system configuration can be tailored to any requirements, allowing for choice of beamwidths as well as transmission modes. The MS70 allows characterization and volume estimation of a school of fish using only one single transmission. Schools of fish can be tracked, followed, and studied using multiple consecutive transmissions. As a consequence of the horizontal transmission using narrow beams, the MS70 allows you to detect and characterize schools of fish even very close to the sea surface. A typical screen capture is provided. A school of herring is shown in both horizontal and vertical views. An echogram view is provided on the left side of the presentation. The borderlines between the views can easily be moved to adjust the size of each view.

It can reduce the need for onboard visits by KONGSBERG Service personnel, saving both time and cost while reducing downtime due to shorter response time on support requests. Kongsberg Remote Services are built on a common technology platform for KONGSBERG products. When installed on board Remote Services can support several KONGSBERG products on the same platform. The system is designed to address the challenges of establishing a secure and reliable remote session to the vessel HiPAP system via satellite communications. KONGSBERG's global secure network is developed in-house and all communications are authenticated and encrypted by a Kongsberg Maritime controlled PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) regime. If a user requires support, the operator simply needs to request to press the 'Remote support' button on the HiPAP Operator Station (APOS). The request will then be handled by a KONGSBERG certified engineer in a KONGSBERG Support center. The engineer can view the operator's screen and assist via telephone or text chat through remote services. Initially, the on board user cannot operate the system during the support session, only view the screen onboard. The next level in the process is to enable the KONGSBERG support engineer to operate the system, check parameters and other status information. Execution of specific tasks can be carried out. If remote operation of the system shall be carried out, risk assessment and remote safe job analysis will have been completed by the customer and KONGSBERG in advance. Remote operation is only done by a certified KONGSBERG engineer after onboard personnel have initiated and approved the session and the time duration is agreed.","Typical tasks than can be executed by Remote Services include:
- Transducer alignment
- Transducer alignment analysis

The uniform three wing solution and the built-in controller also provide full roll control capabilities. The eBird solution is built on an in-line body and three detachable wings. The snap-on/snap-off mechanism makes attachment/removal of wings an easy task during streamer deployment/retrieval and work-boat based maintenance. SmartWing makes it possible to maintain a very slim body to avoid acoustic noise induced by turbulence. eBird is designed to be a part of an outer control loop where all steering and control parameters can be accessed from the seismic vessel. The autonomous inner control loop ensures that eBird will maintain the correct depth and roll angle even if communication through the streamer is interrupted. Each wing is equipped with a battery that is continuously maintenance charged during normal operation. In case of streamer power failure, wing batteries will work as back-up power sources enabling continued operation for more than one week. The eBird technology is protected by several international patents.","• In-line titanium body with 3 detachable wings

Due to its high operating frequency the CP200-5C provides accurate measurements and detailed echograms. The transducer is normally mounted flush with the hull plating. A clamping frame is used to secure the transducer body to a mounting frame. The mounting frame is welded to the bottom plate. The transducer cable penetrates the hull using a cable gland. The cable gland consists of a bushing, rubber gasket, washers and a packing nipple. The transducer can also be flush mounted at the bottom of a blister or a drop keel. The CP200-5C transducer is connected to an echo sounder system. For maximum measurement accuracy, we strongly recommend that you connect a motion reference unit (MRU) to the echo sounder system. If a motion reference unit (MRU) is not available, use a motion sensor to measure roll and pitch. As a minimum solution, a global positioning system (GPS) can be used. To obtain precision data that are both detailed and correct, it is necessary to align the transducer and measure its location and offset in relation to the vessel's coordinate system.

The ST2400 is a towed, lightweight, multiple frequency active sonar for Anti Submarine Warfare
(ASW) and detection of other submerged items. The
towed unit contains a fixed cylindrical array encapsulated in a robust hydrodynamic body. A passive mode
where transmission is turned off is also available.
Advantages of the ST2400 lie in the total performance
of the sonar in the ASW role. Emphasis has been placed
on shallow water capabilities.
Functional description
The active operating modes are omni and sectoral
transmission and multibeam reception covering 360°
with 64 beams of 8° horizontal beamwidth each. The
ST2400 operates from 22 to 29 kHz.
The towed body itself contains several sensors, such
as a Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) probe,
compass and a vertical reference unit.
The lightweight and compact sonar can be installed
without docking.
The design of the towed body provides stability at all
operational velocities, including dipping mode. Automatic depth control is obtained by adjustment of the
towing cable. If the towed unit is lost, an acoustic
pinger will be activated, thus simplifying recovery.
Operations
Multiple screen worksheets are available for control
and presentation of the ST2400 sonar. Presentation
views include omni-directional, sector and B-scan with
doppler and echogram, and also DEMON processing
of passive data.
Sonar data can be presented in a geographical or vessel
reference system. Features include automatic target
and position tracking as well as an audio channel and

The PX Configurator can also be used to calibrate the trawl doors on a remote place where there is no other calibration utility available, like for example the TV80. Catch monitoring sensors are delivered from Simrad readily set up with common default settings. In some cases, you may find that the default parameters do not suit your operational needs. This is for example if you have more than one sensor of any given type. The decision to configure a sensor is one you must make depending on how many sensors you use, and how many of these are identical. Dedicated dialog boxes are provided to configure the new sensor. Note: The PX Configurator only allows you to configure PX sensors. If you wish to use older sensors (not PX family), these must be configured using their dedicated applications before putting them to use. With the PX Configurator, you can configure and change the parameters of the following catch monitoring sensors: PX Flow, PX TrawlEye, PX Universal, PX MultiCatch, PX MultiSensor Mk1, PX MultiSensor Mk2, and PxPos. The user interface comprises several “stand-alone” dialog boxes. Depending on the type of sensor connected, different dialog boxes with dedicated parameters will be used to perform the configuration itself. The configurator parameters allow you to set up which measurements the sensor shall make and which communication channels it shall use for these measurements. Who can program catch monitoring sensors: Sensor configuration is normally performed by authorized Simrad technicians. However, individuals with basic computer skills and access to the necessary equipment should not find it difficult. Necessary tools and equipment: If you purchase a computer locally, make sure that the chosen model meets the functional and technical requirements. The computer must be able to facilitate the various interface requirements made by the PX Configurator, and you may need to add extra Ethernet and serial adapters. The minimum technical requirements are: PX Configurator software, a PC with minimum one COM or USB port available, Sensor programming cable. The programming cable is included in the PX catch monitoring sensors standard delivery.

However, the K-Sync was developed for research vessels and is too powerful for fishing vessels. To address this, a similar concept for fishing vessels, the Simrad TU40 Trigger System, was developed. This system is dedicated for fishing vessels and allows you to specify a chosen system as ""master"", so the TU40 distributes the transmission control to all other hydroacoustic systems on board. The TU40 has twelve independent channels, all of which are isolated and compatible with most commercial hydroacoustic equipment. It runs autonomously and is set up from a commercial computer running the TU40 program. The operational principles of the TU40 involve avoiding interference by setting up one of the hydroacoustic systems as ""master"" or connecting all the sonars and/or echo sounders to a common synchronization system. The TU40 permits each hydroacoustic system to transmit (""ping"") according to a logic trigger pattern established to avoid interference, providing individual control of each system's transmission sequence. It consists of a programmable logic controller (PLC) and other electronic circuitry that provide the synchronized trigger signals, allowing it to control up to 12 hydroacoustic systems.","• Small and intuitive system for synchronization purposes

240,240,240,240,240,240,240,Synthetic Aperture Sonar,"Fish finding, Ocean science","Synthetic aperture sonars combine a number of acoustic pings to form an image with much higher resolution than conventional sonars, typically 10 times higher. HISAS is a wideband SAS sonar with frequency range of 70-100kHz, capable of producing ultra high resolution acoustic images as well as co-registered bathymetry. The sonar is tightly integrated with the INS navigation and motion sensing platform of the HUGIN AUV, and makes use of modern signal processing such as DPCA (Displaced Phase Centre Analysis) to process the raw data into images. The synthetic aperture sonar prototype has recently been tested with success at sea outside Horten, Norway, with signal processing done by Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI). The image above is from this test and shows a sunken wreck standing upright on the bottom. It has a resolution of about 4 cm both along track and across, each acoustic beam being processed from 40 consecutive pings. The azimuth (along-track) resolution of a sonar can be computed as the ratio between the acoustic wavelength and the length of the array. For typical side scan sonars, this ratio is of the order 1:60-1:400 (meaning a resolution of 1 m at 60 and 400 m range, respectively). A longer array will increase this ratio, but fitting such a long array is not always possible or practical on most underwater vehicles. Operation at a higher frequency will increase the ratio, but will at the same time limit the achievable range due to higher absorption. The multi-element transmit array and the programmable transmit waveform generator allows both beam direction and beam coverage to be varied to reduce influence of seabed and sea surface reverberation. The small (in wavelengths) element size gives this sensor a wide field of view, facilitating the use of multi-aspect imaging. HISAS 1030 has two full-length receive arrays on each side of the AUV. They are used to form two SAS images of the same scene with slightly different geometry. This adds considerable robustness to the system, but it also allows very high resolution interferometric processing from SAS data. HISAS can optionally provide a highly accurate measurement of an AUV's displacement (or velocity) in all three dimensions. FOCUS is a complete SAS post-processing toolbox, delivered with HISAS 1030. The output products can be divided into four categories.", -Much higher resolution compared to conventional sonars. -Wideband SAS sonar with frequency range of 70-100kHz. -4 cm resolution along track and across. -Reverberation suppression for reduced influence of seabed and sea surface reverberation. -Multi-aspect imaging facilitated by the small element size. -High resolution interferometric processing from SAS data. -Highly accurate measurement of AUV's displacement (or velocity) in all three dimensions. -FOCUS Synthetic Aperture Sonar: delivered post-processing toolbox.,I don't know,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/sonars/SAS/,,"{'Article': ['https://www.kongsberg.com/globalassets/maritime/km-products/product-documents/seabed-mapping-with-hisas-sonar-for-decommissioning-projects/'], 'Brochure': ['https://www.kongsberg.com/globalassets/maritime/km-products/product-documents/high-resolution-interferometric-synthetic-aperture-sonar---hisas-1030/'], 'Downloads': ['https://www.kongsberg.com//globalassets/maritime/km-products/product-documents/high-resolution-interferometric-synthetic-aperture-sonar---hisas-1030/']}",,,"{""specifications"": {""Unknown Specifications"": [{""Unknown Specification 1"": ""Value 1""}, {""Unknown Specification 2"": ""Value 2""}, {""Unknown Specification 3"": ""Value 3""}, {""Unknown Specification 4"": ""Value 4""}]}}"

248,248,248,248,248,248,248,Non-Differential Position Sensors,Underwater navigation & positioning,"By the introduction of DPS i2 and DPS i4, KONGSBERG fuses decades of experience within GNSS and inertial technology in order to create a fully scalable and future-proof reference solution with emphasis on operational efficiency for Dynamic Positioning - DP applications. Sensor Fusion
DPS i2 and DPS i4 integrate KONGSBERG’s unique motion gyro compass (MGCTM) and motion reference unit (MRUTM) technology. MGC provides INS functionality, and a solution with MRU offers an optimal integration of multi GNSS and inertial sensors, which will ensure high availability and integrity of the position solution. When choosing MGC as the inertial sensor, a high-quality WheelMark gyro compass with no scheduled maintenance, will be a part of the solution. In addition, MGC can serve other on-board systems with attitude data.

As DPS i2 utilizes GPS and GLONASS, DPS i4 adds Galileo and Beidou to supported GNSS systems.

Increased operational efficiency
Inertial technology combined with the latest multi-constellation GNSS technology enables a cost efficient and reliable position reference solution, where no additional augmentation service is required. Still DPS i2 and DPS i4 are fully capable to utilize differential corrections and SBAS services where required. With the ready-to-use possibility of remote service and diagnostics, the DPS i2 and DPS i4 product line is a true solution for the future, benefiting from the KONGSBERG global support service. Cases that previously required a visit from a service engineer, may now be resolved remotely.

SPOOFING AND JAMMING MITIGATION 
A growing concern is the possibility to spoof and jam available GNSS signals. The DPS i-Series has in-built functionality for spoofing and jamming detection and mitigation. This sophisticated functionality ensures a positioning reference the vessel operator can trust throughout the entire operation.   

Scalable
The flexible design of the DPS i2 / DPS i4 product line ensures a scalable and expandable reference solution that can adapt to the specific requirements of any vessel. For the more demanding applications, a combination of DPS i2, DPS i4 and MRU/MGC sensors will, in addition to redundancy, enable precise heading determination and spoofing detection capabilities. DPS i2 / DPS i4 may utilize existing or dedicated MGC or MRU sensors for the integration.",Sensor fusion,,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/vessel-reference-systems/position-systems/non-differential-position-sensors/,,"{'Brochure': [], 'Data sheet': ['https://www.kongsberg.com/contentassets/68318fe026694f74bb05408ffdbb34a7/datasheet_dpsi2.pdf', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/contentassets/68318fe026694f74bb05408ffdbb34a7/datasheet_dpsi4.pdf'], 'Downloads': ['https://www.kongsberg.com//contentassets/68318fe026694f74bb05408ffdbb34a7/datasheet_dpsi2.pdf', 'https://www.kongsberg.com//contentassets/68318fe026694f74bb05408ffdbb34a7/datasheet_dpsi4.pdf']}",,,

The system can be remotely controlled from an external computer via Ethernet access, allowing the user to control transponders and send data for acoustic modem transfer to a modem on a subsea vehicle. APOS, the operator station for µPAP, provides a full range of functions for acoustic positioning and data communication, benefitting from the Cymbal acoustic protocol and all functions available for the HiPAP products. µPAP has full LBL calibration and positioning capabilities and offers a wide range of transponder channels and cNODE transponder models for depths down to 4000 metres. It has built-in motion sensors for compensating the position for vessels' roll and pitch movements, with no need for calibration of roll and pitch alignments but requiring calibration for alignment to the vessel's gyro compass. The system can be interfaced to the vessel heading sensor and GNSS system, with data output available in established formats for user access.","• Compact transducer housing
