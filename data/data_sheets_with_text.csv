The EA640 software
The EA640 software is an intuitive and user-friendly software that runs on the
Hydrographic Operation Station (HOS) or any Windows 10 compatible PC. You
can set up the display to suit your special needs. You can choose different
presentations on the screen for echograms, the map view, digital depth and
other features. Save user settings for different operations and you can use these
at your ease.
EA640 offers internal storage of all raw sample data. This includes all external
input sensor data for replay purposes.
The EA map display
The EA640 map view provides a geographical display of the vessel, the vessel

Simrad EK80 Portable
The EK80 Portable is a complete echo sounder system for scientific use. It is an all in one
rugged solution with compact PC, echo sounder and GPS. Built in WiFi lets you control and
operate the system from any handheld device or laptop.
Description
The EK80 Portable is a compact
solution that can be deployed from a
small vessel in a rough environment.
The system is built around the WBT
Mini transceiver. It utilizes the EK80
software on an integrated computer
with built in GPS. EK80 Portable can
be used with remote desktop through
WiFi. Thus can it be controlled by
your handheld device or through any
laptop on the WiFi network. As a
backup, a small touch-screen is built
in to the solution.
The system is compatible with
any Simrad echo sounder transducer, EK80 Portable onboard a small boat
and a selection of EK80 licenses are
available based on frequency band.
