instruments for mapping and inspection purposes, such as the KONGSBERG HISAS family
of synthetic aperture sonars and the EM family of multibeams. Both underwater and
surface awareness sensors are used for autonomous decision making.
HUGIN Endurance is the largest member of the HUGIN family (Ø1.2 m, 10 m long), yet
