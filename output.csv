High Value HUGIN AUV System,"HUGIN is the most successful commercial Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) available. lt combines IHO quality positioning with the highest resolution sensors on the market. HUGIN collects data from many different sensors concurrently, providing a comprehensive geophysical dataset from a single mission. HUGIN is equipped with swappable batteries and removable data storage enabling continuous operations. The HUGIN AUV System is a multi-role vehicle capable of collecting high-resolution data for commercial, scientific, and defense applications. It is the most flexible AUV available on the market, capable of carrying a wide array of sensors, including synthetic aperture sonars, multi-beam echo sounders, cameras, lasers, sub-bottom profilers, and environmental/scientific sensors.",
Unmatched Product Evolution,"HUGIN has been continuously evolving since development began in 1991. From the first commercial survey in 1997, KONGSBERG and their partners at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment (FFI) have been at the forefront of underwater robotic technology. HUGIN continues to deliver World-class performance, and new capabilities and features are added through software updates and vehicle upgrades.",
Versatile Deployability,"HUGIN can be deployed from dedicated vessels, vessels of opportunity, or from shore. The complete HUGIN system, including operator consoles, launch and recovery system, and the AUV itself, can be delivered in DNV-certified offshore containers. The containers allow for transport by sea, air, and land, and mobilization is easy with only an external power connection required. Various container sizes are available to meet the customer needs.",
