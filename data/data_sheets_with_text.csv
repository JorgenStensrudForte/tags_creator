Subject: Sound Levels from Kongsberg Multibeam’ s and
Single beams
The power output level of an echo sounder is normally specified by giving its
source level in dB relative to 1 μPa at a distance of 1 m from the transmit
transducer. However, this is really a measure of the pressure level of the output
sound wave and is only directly applicable in the farfield. The intensity (power
per unit area) of a sound wave can be found from the pressure level by the
relation I = p2/ρc where ρ is the water density and c the speed of sound. The
quantity ρc is the acoustic impedance of water and for sea water is nominally
taken to be 1.5x106 kg/m2s. Thus, a pressure level in sea water of 1 μPa is
nominally equal to an energy intensity of 0.667x10-18 W/m2, and a pressure level
of for example 210 dB corresponds to an intensity of 667 W/m2.
In the farfield the pressure level of a sound wave will fall off with the square of
the distance, this because of spherical spreading of the wave, and the wave will
be further attenuated due to absorption loss. In the nearfield the pressure level
will be nominally constant as there is no spreading. If the transmit transducer
generating the sound wave is rectangular, there will be a transition region in
which the pressure will fall of proportionally to the distance due to cylindrical
spreading in the direction parallel to the shortest side of the transducer. It may
be noted that in the nearfield the pressure level will have large variations, with
peaks up to about twice the nominal level and also deep nulls, this effect will
however be ignored in this note.
The source level is given by SL = 170.8 + 10lgP + DI. P is the acoustic power
Ac Ac
which is typically half the electric power applied to the transmit transducer. DI
is the transducer’s directivity index which for a rectangular flat transducer can
be approximated by DI = 46.2 – 10lgθ θ where θ and θ are the transmit
x y x y
beamwidths in degrees along and across respectively. The relation between
1
beamwidth and transducer array length, L, depends upon the applied shading
and the number of elements in the array, typically it would be θ = 65λ/L where λ
is the wavelength. The nearfield limit is conventionally given by R = L2/λ.
To derive the pressure levels in the nearfield from the source level of an echo
sounder one must first calculate the pressure level at the largest farfield limit
assuming spherical spreading from the 1-meter reference level used in defining
the source level. From the largest to the smallest nearfield limit the pressure
level will increase linearly with distance, and from the smallest nearfield limit in
to the transducer level the pressure level will be constant.
If the source level of the echo sounder is not known, but both beamwidths or
transducer array lengths or even just area are, the maximum possible pressure
level may still to a good degree be estimated. Then one must rely upon the fact
that there is a maximum acoustic power intensity that can be applied to a
transducer in the order of 2-5 W/cm2 to avoid cavitation (lowest number is typical
at say 12 kHz, highest at say 100 kHz). With shading being applied in one
direction the power will be reduced to about 50-60%, and for both directions to
about 30%.
The calculations outlined above are for the on-axis direction (usually straight
down). Off-axis the pressure level will fall rapidly for a narrow beam (alongtrack
for a multibeam echo sounder), the level will be 20 dB down at a little more than
twice the beamwidth. Across track, the pressure level will typically be 20 dB
down for angles of more than 75-80° of the vertical for flat arrays. At for example
45° the closest nearfield distance will be half that of on-axis, leading to a 3-dB
reduction in pressure level for distances larger than the nearfield distance on-
axis. At 60° the nearfield distance will be reduced by another factor of two and
taking into account the usual level reduction at large beam angles also, the
pressure level would typically be down about 8 dB compared to on-axis. At 70°
the level will be about 16 dB down due a further halving of the nearfield distance
and the beam pattern drop-off. For multibeams which use sectorized
transmission such as most current Kongsberg systems, beam defocusing is
applied in the central sector(s) in shallow waters which implies that the nearfield
will be shortened and the drop-off in pressure level starts earlier.
Sonars may be transmitting horizontally and with a sound speed profile where
the sound speed lessens toward the surface the spreading will cylindrical even in
the farfield due to ducting causing a sound channel at the surface. For
multibeam echo sounders this is usually not the case, except for tilted systems
such as with the dual head EM 3002.

The following table shows the relevant parameters for the currently available
Kongsberg multibeam echo sounders. For each model the alongtrack (transmit)
beamwidth, the source level in dB re 1μPa at 1 meter, calculated nearfield
distances and pressure levels in dB re 1 μPa at the nearfield distances are
provided. The effect of absorption loss is not included in this table.

LiVe FiSh CArrierS
KONGSBERG AquaLink transfers key process data between
the live fish carrier and fish farm through the Maritime
Broadband radio (MBr) link.
Live CCTV streaming gives the crew real time visual information
of status on the fish farm. in addition, water quality parameters
are transmitted for evaluation and appropriate actions.
With AquaLink, the Live Fish Carrier receives valuable weather
data to the ship’s dynamic positioning and manoeuvring system.
AquaLink transfers weather data such as wind, local surface
and sea current at multiple depths via KONGSBERG’s unique
Maritime Broadband radio.
ForAge CArrier
KONGSBERG’s AquaLink transfers key process data between
forage carrier and fish farm through the Maritime Broadband
radio link.
The offloading process is monitored and controlled from a
dedicated operator station onboard the forage carrier, which is
interfaced with the fish farm silo system. This enables maximum
offloading rate without the risk of spillage or unexpected stops.
AquaLink also transfers weather data, such as wind, local
surface current and sea current for multiple water depths,
giving valuable data to the forage carrier’s dynamic positioning
and manoeuvring system. With AquaLink, the forage carrier
is prepared for intensive offloading operations in challenging
weather conditions. Operator Station Forage carrier.

HIPAP 352P
PORTABLE HIGH PRESICION ACOUSTIC POSITIONING
The HiPAP 352P is a portable system designed for tracking ROV’s, tow fish, divers and other subsea objects at several
thousand metres range. The system operates in SSBL mode where it measures the distance and direction to subsea
transponders and computes a 3D position in local coordinates or in geographical coordinates. HiPAP 352P is designed
to be a portable system for easy installation on surface vessels or other surface units. APOS, the operator station for
HiPAP 352P, provides the full range of functions for acoustic positioning and data communication. HiPAP 352P bene-
fits from the Cymbal acoustic protocol and all functions that are available for the HiPAP products are also available for
HiPAP 352P. HiPAP 352P has full LBL calibration and positioning capabilities and can be used for position box in, cali-
bration and positioning. The system is offering the user a wide range of transponder channels and cNODE transponder
models for depths down to 4000 meters. HiPAP 352P has built in motion sensors for compensating the position for
vessels roll and pitch movements. These models have no need for calibration of roll and pitch alignments but need to
calibrate for alignment to the vessels’ gyro compass. The system can be interfaced to the vessel heading sensor and
GNSS system. Data output to users are available in established formats. The HiPAP 352P-MGC contains a motion
sensor and a gyro compass. This model has no need for calibration to determine roll, pitch and heading alignments. To
meet various demands from the marked, HiPAP 352P transducer is available in several models with respect to motion
and heading sensors.

maximum range and angular accuracy can be achieved. Outside the main coverage range and elevation angular accuracy are reduced, therefore a
depth input for aiding is recommended. Whilst within the main coverage, range is up to 5000 m, operational tests show ranges out to 1000 m at 80
degrees or near the horizontal. The signal to noise ratio 20 dB is within the signal bandwidth.

HAIN
Subsea
7000
Application
HAIN Subsea 7000 is designed to provide fast precise position updates
with full attitude output for deep sea mining, cable trenching, ROV
survey, AUV navigation and towed fish tracking.
Seamless compatibility with HiPAP
As the Hain Subsea 7000 has its own on board processer, interfacing to
any HiPAP system is easy and without the need for an additional topside
computer. The new user friendly HAIN interface is now assessable on
HiPAP and uPAPAPOS operator stations.
SSBL and Sparse LBL Aiding
Position aiding to HAIN can be provided by an SSBL system or via a
Sparse LBL ranges. A cPAPLBL Transceiver can be interfaced to the
HAIN directly and measures LBL ranges to cNODEtransponders on
known seabed reference points.
Fast Calibration of Sparse LBL Arrays
Fast absolute position calibration of seabed reference transponders is
possible with an ROV adaptive box-in. With this technique the ROV is
positioned with SSBL and HAIN whilst flying a circle around the seabed
transponder and simultaneously measuring LBL ranges with a cPAP
Transceiver. Relative position accuracy can be further improved with
baseline measurements between the seabed transponders.
Interfacing made easy:
Connection and power to the aiding sensors is made directly via the
HAIN unit with 3 x 24VDC and 1 x 12VDC outputs available. Therefore
only one connection is required between the vehicle and the HAIN
system, simplifying connection to the vehicle MUX . Attitude output and
1pps time sync is also available from HAIN to multibeam, laser and
navigation systems on the vehicle.
DVL Aiding
Industry standard DVLs including Nortek and RDI can be co-located with
the HAIN to improve the robustness of the INS position . The units can
be pre-calibrated together with the HAIN post processing software prior
to mobilisation.

Rules for transducer handling
To secure the long life and accurate results, the transducer must be handled
correctly.

• A transducer must always be handled as a delicate item. Wrongful actionsmay damage the transducer beyond repair. Observe these transducer hand-
ling rules:

• Do not activate the transducer when it is out of the water.
• Do not handle the transducer roughly, avoid impacts.
• Do not expose the transducer to direct sunlight or excessive heat.
• Do not use high-pressure water, sandblasting, metal tools, or strong solventsto clean the transducer face.

• Do not damage the outer protective skin on the transducer face.
• Do not lift the transducer by the cable.
• Do not step on the transducer cable.
• Do not damage the transducer cable, avoid sharp objects.","The SIMRAD C-ALL is a revolutionary echo sounder transducer that offers various key features and technical specifications.

Introduction
The Simrad ES70-7CD is a split-
beam composite transducer with a
large bandwidth. This provides a fine
range resolution, which is important
for single fish detection and target
strength measurement. The transducer
has four quadrants. The ES70-7CD
has been design to withstand a large
water pressure, and is therefore well
suited for underwater vehicles and
other submerged platforms.

Mackerel detection
The school of mackerel is dead
ahead of the vessel. It can not bee
seen in the horizontal view, only in
the vertical view. The tilt indicator
shown in the vertical picture tells you
that you need more tilt in order to
see the school in the horizontal view.
The school is clearly shown in the
vertical view at about 200 meter away
from the vessel. The vertical view is
primary used to measure the depth of
the school. This view is provided so
you do not need to sail directly over
the school. This would scatter the fish,
and break up the school in several
smaller parts. The vertical view thus
makes it easier to catch the fish.
Operational frequency is 30 kHz using
Hyperbolic FM transmission.
Looking into the seine
“Off centre” mode is selected
to obtain better resolution in the
direction of the school in horizontal
and vertical views.
The SX90 has a superb short range
detection. In this screen capture the
sonar is operated with a 300 meters
range setting, and the fish is no more
than 50 meters from the vessel, as
clearly seen in both the horizontal and
the vertical presentation. In the top
right hand corner all PI depth sensors
are fully marked down to 80 fathoms.
SIMRAD SX90
Scattered mackerel detection
The SX90 sonar is operated at 30
kHz. This upper frequency is selected
because it will provide the narrowest
beam. At 30 kHz, no other sonars
can interfer with the performance of
this sonar, even with mulitple similar
sonars were operating in the area.
The mackerel can be seen as a long
“stripe of fish” ahead of the vessel in
both horizontal and vertical views.
The water depth is 100 meter, and the
echo from a pipe line can be seen in
the vertical presentation behind the
vessel.
Blue Whiting
This screen captures shows how
the SX90 has detected a school of
Blue Whiting. The range is set 4500
meters, and the sonar detects the Blue
Whiting all the way out to the end of
the range.
SIMRAD SX90
Tuna
This sonar presentation shows a
school of tuna. It has been detected
all the way out to 2500 meters. In
the vertical view you can also see a
plankton layer at about 150 meters
depth. Such layers can in some
cases disturb the range detection
capabilities, and create unwanted
echoes as the horisontal beam hits the
layer at one point in range. The SX90
overcomes this problem by means of
its efficient filtering capabilities, and
masks out the plankton layer in the
same manner as unwanted surface
echoes.
Wreck detection
This screen capture shows a long
range detection of a sunken 35.000
ton cargo vessel. You can see it at
10° port side, it is marked with target
tracking triangle. The wreck lays at
about 100 meters depth. The other
echoes are shallow banks in the area.
The sonar is operated at 23 kHz using
“FM Auto” and “Narrow Beam”. The
position of the vessel, as well as time
and date, is indicated in the dialog
in the lower right hand corner of the
presentation.

SY50
The compact size and ease of installation makes the Simrad SY50 ideal for vessels
with limited room for a sonar installation. There is no transceiver cabinet, only
a small power supply. All the transceiver electronics are contained inside the
transducer.
The communication between the hull unit and the computer on the bridge is
limited to a single Ethernet cable. Both the hull unit and the computer may
also operate on DC power. This makes the SY50 a perfect choice for coastal
fishing vessels that have no 3-phase power system on-board. Using 256 individ-
ual receiver- and transmitter channels the SY50 offers a clear and high-resolution
sonar presentation, one that is not previously seen on a sonar in this price range.
Our well known “large sonar“ functions like full beam stabilisation, vertical views,
FM transmission, single-ping transmission (horizontal and vertical in one ping)
are included. The popular “Winson” operating software known from all Simrad
products is used. With the familiar user interface available in almost 20 languages
the SY50 is exceptionally easy to use.
The SY50 is provided with a small and compact computer. This computer does
not contain any fans or other moving parts. It can therefore safely be installed
and used in a humid environment.
To simplify the basic operating features we can provide a small operating panel.
This panel is smaller than the other panels we have. It is easy to install among
other equipment on a populated control desk. The operating panel communicate
with the computer using a single USB cable.

","The SBP 27 is the next generation narrow beam, multibeam sub-bottom profiler, and is the successor of the SBP 120 and SBP 300. The system has new and improved technology, wider bandwidth 2 – 9 kHz and accordingly improved range resolution.

This is obtained by one linear transmitter array mounted along the vessel keel, and one linear hydrophone array (shared system. For the three-degree transmitter, the frequency with the EM 122/302) mounted orthogonal to the keel. The footprint of the transmitter array is wide acrosstrack between 3.5 kHz and 6.5 kHz. Because the transmit beam is wide acrosstrack and all hydrophones are sampled individually, the SBP 27 can make a fan of narrow beams acrosstrack per ping. The array geometry of the SBP 27 is the same as that used by the EM multibeam echo sounders. For reception, it uses the wideband receive antenna of the EM system. With much narrower beam widths than conventional sub-bottom profilers, the SBP 27 provides superior specular return to backscatter ratio and thereby. The benefits of using large arrays are: multibeam capability of the SBP 27 is useful for increasing source level, finding the specular return(s) in rough terrain, resolving lateral specular returns in rough terrain, detecting buried objects, and obtaining information about the sloping angle of sediments.","Operated in parallel with the EM 122 or EM 302 multibeam echo sounder.
