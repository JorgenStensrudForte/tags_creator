In the 1990s, designers enclosed the transducer in an oil-filled dome to provide mechanical protection and eliminate flooding due to O-ring failure on the traditional exposed transducer shaft. While the oil-filled dome solved the O-ring flooding failures, it introduced beam defocusing in two conditions, warm & shallow and cold & deep. The beam defocusing effect becomes more extreme in warm shallow water as temperature increases and cold deep water as depth increases. Until now, there has been no solution to this problem, aside from using a high-resolution scanning sonar head.
Our engineers solved this problem by designing a patented acoustic lens that maintains beam focus through operational temperature and depth changes, significantly improving sonar performance and resulting in images that are much sharper. The Clariscan acoustic lens behaves like an optical contact lens, correcting the refraction caused by the oil in the dome.
Clariscan is currently available in a 4000M depth-rated version.
Applications

Obstacle avoidance
Pipeline survey
Target detection
Underwater construction support

Data Comparison
Clariscan Sonar vs. Standard Sonar with Composite Transducer
Deep water testing in the Gulf of Mexico clearly showed the difference in image quality between the Clariscan sonar head and the standard domed sonar with composite transducer. The two sonar heads were mounted side by side on an ROV and thus exposed to the same temperature, pressure and salinity conditions, and were operated simultaneously during image capture.
The three images below clearly show the image quality of the Clariscan sonar (left image) is superior and rivals that of a high-resolution scanning sonar head.

https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/ocean-science/ekmp/,EK Mission Planner,,"This EK mission planner is a planning and programming tool for autonomous echo sounders such as Simrad WBAT and Simrad WBT Mini. You can set up all necessary parameters related to ""wakeup"" and ""sleep"" times for the echo sounder, as well as transmission modes, intervals, and other parameters.
After you have planned the deployment carefully, all settings are uploaded to the transceiver.


In addition to running a predefine schedule, you can first use the EK Mission Planner to define the ping configurations and send these to the instrument. Then you can use the ""interactive mode"" (or ""command mode"" if you like) to control the transmissions from an external source such as an onboard controller. ""Interactive mode"" also enables the reading of key information such as mean volume backscattering strength in layers in real-time.


Key Features

Control of all necessary parameters needed to  program a mission plan
The mission plan is set by programming in Ping Groups, Ping Group Libraries, Phases, and Ensembles
License-free software 

Typical applications

Ocean observatories
Fish migration studies
Long-term biological studies
Improved fish stock assessment
Water column profiling

When making a mission plan you start by selecting the transducer(s) you will use for the deployment. The next step is to define ping groups, i.e. all parameters for a ping, such as CW (Continuous Wave) versus FM (Frequency Modulated), pulse duration, transmit power, and so on. The third step is to define the duration of the deployment which can be divided into several phases. Usually, it's sufficient to use only one single phase. The last step in the mission planning is to put the ping groups you defined into ensembles. You can choose if the ensembles shall be repeated for a fixed number of iterations or for as many times as possible within the time span you choose. After planning the mission, you can set the environmental parameters. After completing these steps, you are ready to connect to the transceiver, send the mission plan to the transceiver and deploy.

The Simrad CP60 can measure up to five individual layers of water current. The transducer operates on 200 kHz. This frequency offers a range that is deep enough for most purse seines. The measurements provided are the speed of the water current and geographical or relative direction. The CP60 also provides a backscatter display for each channel.

The CP60 can export the measured water current data to other systems on your vessel. Providing this information to a Simrad sonar is specifically useful. However, the CP60 uses a standard NMEA datagram, which means that any system on your vessel can benefit from the data.

Besides the water current measurements, the CP60 offers a built-in single-beam echo sounder. The beam opening on this transducer element is 27 degrees. This beam opening angle makes it ideal for fish detection higher up in the water column.

The Simrad ES70 is a high accuracy professional single- and split-beam multi purpose fish finder. It is designed for the professional fishery community. The latest innovations in computer technology have been used to satisfy the increasing needs from our demanding customers: ""Top performance at any depth, and easy to operate!""

The ES70 screen capture shows the echogram provided by a Simrad ES38 split-beam transducer. An area of the echogram has been zoomed in. Additional information panes are used to reveal fish position and size distribution.
The Simrad ES70 is a modular system, the basic configuration consists of a computer, a transceiver and a transducer. Using this basic configuration you can start with a simple single frequency single beam system. Later, you can expand the system to a multi-frequency echo sounder using single and/or split-beam transducers. You can choose from a wide variety of advanced software functions, transducers, and transceivers.
Multiple frequencies are available for the Simrad ES70. This is because different frequencies and transducers are used for different fisheries. Mackerel, Tuna, Anchovies, Herring and other schooled fish are best measured using a high frequency system, typically 120 or 200 kHz depending on the depth. Cod, Pollock, Seith and other bottom fish can be measured using 70 or 38 kHz systems, while 18 kHz is used for deep water species. Any two of the available frequencies can be assembled in the same transceiver cabinet. Each frequency is operated separately as with individual echo sounders, orsimultaneously to see the frequency response from the fish on two different frequencies. You can add up to a total of six frequencies on the screen at the same time, or on separate monitors, using available software, computer technology and display monitors.
With the Simrad ES70, Simrad introduces a new way to present optional information. We call them information panes. With a click on the requested icon on the top bar, the information you wish to add to the echogram is presented in a dedicated frame. You can place the frame wherever you want, and you can change it to any size and shape. It is even transparent, so you will not loose any information from the echogram behind it.
The new zoom function provided by the Simrad ES70 is innovative, efficient and very easy to use. Using the trackball you can establish an area on the echogram. The information within this area is displayed in the Zoom pane, and the fish biomass is calculated and displayed. The zoomed area can be used to investigate a school of pelagic fish, or an area close to bottom.

System description
The Simrad ES80 is the most modern “high-end” split beam echo sounder in the professional fishery market. Based on more than 60 years of research and development in close collaboration with fishermen and leading marine scientists, this wideband echo sounder system has succeeded the famous ES60 and ES70 systems.
Simrad has manufactured fish finders for over 65 years, and we have more than 25 years of experience with split-beam technology. Our first split-beam fish finder, operating on 38 kHz, came on the market in 1984. A 70 kHz system quickly followed it. Today, we can offer a wide range of operational frequencies from 18 kHz, used for detecting deep water species, up to 333 kHz, used for finding and measuring plankton.
The Simrad ES80 is the fifth-generation professional split beam fish finder for the worldwide fishing community. We have designed it to satisfy the increasing need of our demanding customers: ""Top performance at any depth and easy to operate”. The latest innovations in computer and signal processing techniques are used to create a sophisticated but also intuitive echo sounder.
The Simrad ES80 is a wideband echo sounder. It can operate with operational frequencies ranging from 10 to 500 kHz. With a suitable transducer, the ES80 can use frequency sweeps (""chirps"") across a range of frequencies. This functionality gives you an increased resolution on the longer ranges.
Initially designed for our scientific sounders, the ES80 can also offer the ""target response"" (TS) curve. This function makes it easier to determine which species you are looking at.
The echo sounder system is modular, and you can assemble any combination of transceivers and transducers to fit your purposes. In a typical configuration, the ES80 comprises:

Display
One Processor Unit (computer)
One or more transceiver units
An Ethernet switch (if you use more than one transceiver)
One or more single- or split-beam transducers

The ES80 can work with the General Purpose Transceiver (GPT), the Wide Band Transceiver (WBT) and the EK15 Transceiver.

System description
The FM90 has a fast refresh rate that allows you to view the sonar images in real time. The FM90 enables use of your existing PI/PX catch monitoring sensors. It operates equally well in the water column and close to the bottom.
The FM90 Multibeam Trawl Sonar offers many advantages over conventional mechanically-scanning trawl sonars in most applications. However, it is not a complete replacement in some applications. We recommend the FM90 mainly for surface, pelagic, and semi-pelagic trawling on soft bottom. For bottom trawling and trawling on hard bottom we recommend the FS70 Trawl Sonar.
The FM90 Sonar communicates with the vessel by means of a third-wire system using very high bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL2) communication, transmitting real-time images of the net opening at rapid refresh rates. In addition, an echo sounder looking up (""up sounder"") monitors fish escaping over the net, while another echo sounder shows the foot-rope, the sea bottom, and the fish entering the net.
By means of the submerged Trawl Unit, the FM90 communicates with a number of Simrad PI/PX 40 kHz catch monitoring sensors by means of hydroacoustic links. Up to six measurements can be made simultaneously. Standard pitch, roll, depth, and temperature sensors are also built in to the Trawl Unit.
The FM90 is a solid-state sonar system. This design eliminates moving parts, and increases reliability and availability during fishing operations. The FM90 is backed by the product warranty and global service network offered by Simrad.
The FM90 is a unique sonar, both in design and functionality. When the FM90 sonar pings, it sends out sound energy in a 240-degree sector. This energy is reflected from the net, from fish, and from other targets in the water column. The reflected energy is received by the transducer, processed, and shown on the display. Because the FM90 pings across a wide area in one ping, the refresh rate to generate a picture of the net opening is almost instantaneous. This gives you real-time images, allowing you to adjust to very fast movements of fish schools.
The FM90 uses an updated version of Kongsberg Mesotech's tried and tested M3 Sonar® multibeam processing software, successfully deployed world-wide for many years. The software uses innovative processing algorithms to automatically optimize the image quality specifically for fishing applications. It includes FM transmissions (also known as ""Chirp"") to ensure a clutter-free picture with a very high resolution in range.
The FM90 Processor Unit is controlled by the Microsoft® Windows® operating system. This allows for a flexible choice of presentation modes, and for a large range of user applications.

System Units
Processor Unit
A dedicated maritime computer is provided with the FM90 Multibeam Trawl Sonar. The Processor Unit is normally mounted on the bridge.
The FM90 Processor Unit is a rugged and powerful computer. It is designed for long life in a demanding maritime environment. It contains the operational software, and offers the user interface that allows you to control the FM90. It also controls the interface to peripheral devices.
The Processor Unit is based on the Microsoft® 64-bit Windows 7 operating system.

Power/VDSL Unit
The Power/VDSL Unit includes both the power supply and the modem required to communicate with the Sonar Head in one box.
This unit provides power to the Sonar Head and aids communication between the Sonar Head and the Processor Unit. The Power/VDSL Unit connects to the Processor Unit and the Sonar Head with an Ethernet cable. The Power/VDSL Unit must be mounted on top of the bridge console or recessed and flush mounted into the bridge console.

Trawl Unit
The Trawl Unit is made up of several components, including the Sonar Head, enclosed in a Deployment Pack.
In addition to the FM90 Sonar Head, the Trawl Unit includes the third-wire extension whip and hydrophone(s). Mounting shackles on the Deployment Pack aid in attaching the Trawl Unit to the net. An access panel provides easy access to the third-wire whip and strain-relief block, minimizing the need to open the Deployment Pack.
The Trawl Unit contains an aft-looking catch hydrophone to communicate with your catch monitoring sensors. An optional forward-looking PI hydrophone communicates with sensors mounted on the trawl door, if you have any. The Trawl Unit is attached to the third wire, which carries sonar data to the Processor Unit.

Users can define their own user settings, leading to clear and easily comprehensible sonar images. In a screen capture from the North Sea, a 10 ton school of tuna was detected, and tracking started. The tracking functionality is crucial for successful catch, enabling tracking of the school all the way to the vessel without losing any information. When the seine is set, the skipper gains full control to maximize the catch. The Simrad SH90 also ensures a noise and clutter-free screen, enabling the skipper to focus on the targets without acting as a 'human filter'. Additionally, detailed information about school density, speed, depth, heading, and size is provided. The high frequency Simrad SH90 is an ideal companion to the Simrad SX90 low frequency sonar."," - 360° Omnidirectional sonar

We have created an online simulator so you can experience these yourself. Try it here!


Trawler
On a trawler, the forward-looking transducer is mounted on the vessel’s bow, well protected against acoustic noise from the hull, machinery and propellers. The high resolution and long range allow you to detect and investigate single fish and schools - even those close to the bottom - from a distance of several hundred meters. The sonar beams point forward in a 120 degrees swath.
Purse seiner
On a purse seiner, the side-looking transducer gives you full control over the setting of the seine. It is installed on the side of the hull facing the purse seine. There is no need to retract the transducer using a large hull unit. A large horizontal coverage area provides you with a full overview. The 256 individual beams have a horizontal coverage area of 160 degrees and the vertical beam width is typically 5 to 8 degrees (varies with the frequency).

https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/commercial-fisheries/fisherysonar/simrad-st90/,Simrad ST90,,"If high performance is your number 1 criterion when choosing a sonar, such as long range, high resolution, narrow beams and high source levels, the Simrad ST90 is your natural choice. We made no compromises during the design of the ST90. Our goal was to make the ultimate high-performance fish-finding sonar. With the Simrad ST90, we use lower frequencies than the SX90 and SU90 sonars.






To achieve this, a completely new transducer was designed. Each transducer element is larger than the SX90 and SU90 elements, but the number of elements is the same as the SU90. This high number of elements allows for the same narrow beam and a longer range. The ST90 has been designed to search with very long ranges in all weather and sea conditions. Whether it is heavy weather, hard bottom, open waters, weak targets - all echoes are handled by the sonar due to the fully stabilized and very narrow beams combined with the cutting edge signal processing.
The centre operational frequency is 19 kHz, but you can select any operational frequency from 14 to 24 kHz in steps of 1 kHz. The cylindrical multi-element transducer allows the omnidirectional sonar beams to be tilted electronically from -10 to +84 degrees. These features allow you to track schools of fish automatically and to observe the whole water volume around the vessel.
The narrow beam opening angle (6.5° @ 17 kHz) and the high source level makes the ST90 a very powerful and high resolution low frequency sonar. The narrow beams provided by the ST90 give you several advantages.

They increase the range and resolution and offer a vertical view with additional details and a clearer picture.
They make the ST90 even more ideal when you need to search for fish close to the sea bottom, or close to the surface, at long ranges.
They provide a far better vertical view with less ""bottom climbing"" than what is seen on sonars with a wider beam.
The narrow beams also decrease the noise level.

It is common for sonars to require many pings to build the various views in the echo presentation. These sonars may, for example, need one ping to build the 360 degrees omni view and then several other pings to fetch the echoes for the vertical views. On the ST90, all the sonar views in the presentation are built using the echoes from one single ping. This feature dramatically improves the update rate and provides better real-time information.

The SU90 allows you to choose an operational frequency between 20 to 30 kHz (in 1 kHz steps). The cylindrical multi-element transducer allows the omnidirectional sonar beams to be tilted electronically from +10 to –60 degrees. This allows you to automatically track schools of fish and observe the whole water volume around the vessel. A stabilizing system is included for electronic pitch and roll compensation.



Compared to the Simrad SX90, the number of channels is increased by 50%, giving the sonar an even better performance in selectivity and range.

https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/commercial-fisheries/trigger-systems/tu40/,Simrad TU40,,"The Simrad TU40 is developed for fishing vessels as a small and intuitive system for synchronization purposes.


On research vessels, the hydroacoustic system are the main scientific tools. Nothing can disturb the received echoes, as this will make the echo data unusable for the scientists. For this reason, the K-Sync was developed. It controls the transmission for all the hydroacoustic systems onboard the vessel, synchronizing them in groups by the transmission rate.
However, the K-Sync is too powerful for fishing vessels. That is why we developed a similar concept for fishing, the Simrad TU40 Trigger System. This system is dedicated for fishing vessels. You specify a chosen system as ""master"", and the TU40 distributes the transmission control to all other hydroacoustic systems on board.
What THE SIMRAD TU40 does
In this example from a Simrad ES80 echo sounder, compare area (A) with area (D) to see what the Simrad TU40 does.

(A) All the hydroacoustic systems on the vessel are synchronized. The echogram is clean and you can identify small fish.
(B) Two echo sounders are in operation, but they are not synchronized. You can see that the interference disrupts the echogram, as the number of short pulses increase.
(C) Four sonars have been started, but these are not synchronized. The interference is stronger, and it is very difficult to see any targets.
(D) All the hydroacoustic systems on the vessel have been turned on. The echogram is completely disrupted with interference, making the echo sounder useless.
Basic facts
The TU40 has twelve independent channels. All the channels are isolated, and the unit is compatible with most commercial hydroacoustic equipment, not only with Simrad equipment.
The Trigger Unit runs autonomously. It is set up from a commercial computer running the TU40 program. This application provides the user interface, which allows you to monitor status, settings, and transmit trigger schedules. Once setup is completed, the TU40 program can be closed. The computer can be disconnected from the Trigger Unit, and even put to other use.
Operational principles
Whenever more than one hydroacoustic system is installed on a vessel, interference may occur. To avoid interference, you can either set up one of the hydroacoustic systems as ""master"", or connect all the sonars and/orecho sounders to a common synchronization system. By means of trigger signals, a common synchronization system will provide individual control of each sonar and/or echo soundertransmission (""ping"") sequence.
""In physics, interference is the phenomenon in which two waves superpose each other to form a resultant wave of greater orlower amplitude. Interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other,either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency. Interference effectscan be observed with all types of waves, for example, light, radio, acoustic, surface water waves or matter waves.""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation), April 2016
The TU40 permits each hydroacoustic system to transmit (""ping"") according to a logic trigger pattern established to avoid interference. This pattern is made by defining one or more hydroacoustic reference systems, and give these transmit priority. Systems operating in the same frequency range are permitted to transmit simultaneously.
The Trigger Unit consists of a programmable logic controller (PLC) and other electronic circuitry that provide the synchronized trigger signals. The standard Trigger Unit can control up to 12 hydroacoustic systems.

The operating principle of this SBP is to the same as that of a multibeam echo sounder, but the signal frequency is lower in order to penetrate the sea floor. Transmission is made by a dedicated projector array, normally of the same length as the multibeam projector and mounted parallel to this. The SBP 120/300 shares receiver array with the EM.
Deeper penetration
The SBP 120/300 Sub bottom profiler has a much narrower beam width than a conventional sub bottom profiler with correspondingly lesser smearing. It thus provides deeper penetration into the bottom, and higher angular resolution. Compared to the other class of narrow beam SBPs: the parametric sediment profilers, a significantly higher source level can be produced by the large transmitter array of the SBP 120. This enables better penetration into the sediments.
Stabilised for ships attidude
The transmit beam and the receiver beams are stabilised for pitch and roll, respectively.
Several simultaneous beams
The receiver beam former have access to the digitized individual hydrophone signals of the receiver array. This is utilized to generate several beams per ping providing the SBP 120 with the unique feature of being a true multibeam sub bottom profiler.
Integration with EM 124/304
The sub bottom profiler is tightly integrated with the EM 124/304 multibeam echo sounder:

It makes use of the same receiver array and preamplifier as the EM. The EMs preamplifier is filtering the received signals into a high frequency channel used by the EM and a low frequency (2-8 kHz) channel that is used by the SBP.
It uses the water depth measured by the EM for automatic setting of the observation window.
If the bottom is sloping, the EM can estimate the local slope angles and inform the SBP 120, so that the beams can be directed perpendicularly to the bottom, in order to get the best resolution and contrast
Pinging can be synchronized so that interference is minimized. For deeper waters SBP 120/300 can transmit several pings for each multibeam ping, without affecting the operation or ping rate of the EM.

","The SBP 120/300 Sub bottom profiler operates on the same principle as a multibeam echo sounder, utilizing a lower signal frequency for deeper sea floor penetration. It features a dedicated projector array and shares a receiver array with the EM system. With a narrower beam width, it offers deeper penetration and higher angular resolution compared to conventional sub bottom profilers. Stabilized for ships' attitude, it also provides several simultaneous beams and is tightly integrated with the EM 124/304 multibeam echo sounder.

https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/sonars/SAS/,Synthetic Aperture Sonar,,"Much higher resolution
Synthetic aperture sonars combine a number of acoustic pings to form an image with much higher resolution than conventional sonars, typically 10 times higher. HISAS is a wideband SAS sonar with frequency range of 70-100kHz, capable of producing ultra high resolution acoustic images as well as co-registered bathymetry. The sonar is tightly integrated with the INS navigation and motion sensing platform of the HUGIN AUV, and makes use of modern signal processing such as DPCA (Displaced Phase Centre Analysis) to process the raw data into images.
4 cm resolution
The synthetic aperture sonar prototype has recently been tested with success at sea outside Horten, Norway, with signal processing done by Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI). The image above is from this test and shows a sunken wreck standing upright on the bottom. It has a resolution of about 4 cm both along track and across, each acoustic beam being processed from 40 consecutive pings. If the reproduction of the image is good, one can observe details such as the wire running from the bow to the top of the mast.
Basic concepts
The azimuth (along-track) resolution of a sonar can be computed as the ratio between the acoustic wavelength and the length of the array. For typical side scan sonars, this ratio is of the order 1:60-1:400 (meaning a resolution of 1 m at 60 and 400 m range, respectively). A longer array will increase this ratio, but fitting such a long array is not always possible or practical on most underwater vehicles. Operation at a higher frequency will increase the ratio, but will at the same time limit the achievable range due to higher absorption. The Synthetic Aperture Sonar principle overcomes these limitations by utilising data from several consecutive pings to synthesize a longer sonar array. A fundamental limitation of SAS systems is that the platform cannot travel further than half the length of the receive array per ping interval (which in turn determines the range). For SAS systems, the maximum range is proportional to the receive array length, and inversely proportional to the platform speed. The theoretical azimuth resolution in SAS is half the length of each element in the receive array, at all ranges. In general, this resolution is not practically achievable, and the practical resolution will be 1.5 – 2 times lower. The range resolution is, as in regular side scan sonars, a function of the bandwidth.
Reverberation suppression
The multi-element transmit array and the programmable transmit waveform generator allows both beam direction and beam coverage to be varied to reduce influence of seabed and sea surface reverberation. Waveform, pulse length and transmit power are fully programmable.
Multi-aspect imaging
The small (in wavelengths) element size gives this sensor a wide field of view, facilitating the use of multi-aspect imaging. The principle is illustrated in the illustration below. In practice, the operator can view a continuous ""movie"" of an object seen from different aspect angles. This feature effectively adds another dimension to the data set, and greatly increases the probability of both manual and computerized classification of mine-like objects in cluttered areas.

Bathymetry
HISAS 1030 has two full-length receive arrays on each side of the AUV. They are used to form two SAS images of the same scene with slightly different geometry. This adds considerable robustness to the system, but it also allows very high resolution interferometric processing from SAS data. The specification is for relative bathymetry resolution better than 50x50 cm to full range, but in practice the resolution may be considerably better which will allow 3D imaging of mines and mine-like objects.
High resolution velocity measurement

HISAS can optionally provide a highly accurate measurement of an AUV's displacement (or velocity) in all three dimensions. This measurement can be utilised by an aided inertial navigation system, and will significantly reduce position error growth when absolute position.
FOCUS Synthetic Aperture Sonar
Signal Processing Toolbox FOCUS is a complete SAS post-processing toolbox, delivered with HISAS 1030. The figure on the last page shows the main building blocks in FOCUS.
The output products can be divided into four categories:

Navigation
Rapid result - dynamically focused multibeam side scan images, low resolution bathymetry
High resolution - streaming SAS imagery and relative bathymetry of configurable resolution
Classification - very high resolution imagery, bathymetry and other advanced products.

The toolbox includes integrated SAS micronavigation and inertial navigation, time and wavenumber domain beamforming, phase gradient autofocus (PGA) and seafloor height estimation by cross-correlation and interferometry. Data is made available in standard file formats (XTF sonar files, Kongsberg .ALL bathymetry data, GeoTIFF mosaic, etc). Depending on the required processing speed, a range of hardware options are available. Typical processing speed is 2-5 times faster than real-time for high resolution SAS imagery. Solutions are available for integrating FOCUS with third party post-mission analysis and display software. Parts or all of the FOCUS processing can also be applied in real time inside the underwater vehicle at the expense of added volume, weight and power consumption.

EK80 scientific wideband echo sounder



The TD50 software reads the incredibly clean raw data from the source systems in real-time, and delivers accurate live visualization of the ocean space beneath the vessel to the scientific lab onboard and/or to the bridge. Previously this data had to be post-processed before the 3D potential of the system was realized. A live feed is now available. Researchers and vessel crews benefit from a new highly effective decision support tool that can enhance vessel efficiency and the effectiveness of scientific surveys in general.



The TD50 Multibeam 3D Visualization Software is shown presenting sand eels on sand bottom. The raw data is taken from the ME70 Scientific multibeam echo sounder on M/S Simrad Echo.
Accurate 3D visualization gives you a better understanding of the marine ecosystem. It allows precise measurement of schools of fish rather than estimating size and shapes based on models. Additionally, a 3D view of bottom topography and the related bottom habitats further enhances the understanding of marine ecosystems. When accurate 3D visualization is delivered in real time, the benefits are significant.
The TD50 is especially relevant to projects using 'adaptive sampling', as the live 3D stream of the survey area enables you to see specific attributes as the vessel passes over them, allowing action for further inspection to be taken immediately.
The live 3D stream from the source systems can be delivered to multiple locations on board which allows for better interaction between scientists and the vessel operators, which is typically important in demanding operations where the vessel interacts with objects in the water column. Research vessels engaged in an active sampling of biology such as trawling can also improve their capabilities, with the TD50 system effectively providing a 'long range camera' below the surface.
