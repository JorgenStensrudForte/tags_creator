HUGIN collects data from many different sensors concurrently, providing a comprehensive geophysical dataset from a single mission. HUGIN is equipped with swappable batteries and removable data storage enabling continuous operations. The HUGIN AUV System is a multi-role vehicle capable of collecting high resolution data for commercial, scientific and defense applications. It is the most flexible AUV available on the market, capable of carrying a wide array of sensors, including synthetic aperture sonars, multi-beam echo sounders, cameras, lasers, sub-bottom profilers and environmental/ scientific sensors. Since the introduction in the 1990s, HUGIN AUVs have completed more commercial surveys than any other AUV and continues to deliver World leading performance. HUGIN also processes data in-mission, providing an autonomous pipe tracking capability, terrain navigation and target recognition.

This means that these models are per default delivered without external display for configuration and operation. All operation and functionality are handled from typically the ECDIS in an integrated bridge system. The SeaPos 300 sensors are hence type approved with ECDIS from different manufacturers and brands, in order to avoid installing a redundant display/ keyboard. One important principle of e-navigation is to reduce the number of displays on the bridge. The navigator needs to have important information easily available in order to reduce response time for decisions. Better integration will lead to a better bridge environment as well as a simpler installation. Interface The interface to other navigation systems is provided via network or serial interface (RS-422), in accordance with international standards.  Easy to install and maintain The SeaPos 300 series is by default delivered with a bracket containing a solution for strain relief in both ends. The unit is easily configured via a built-in WEB user interface (UI). Software updates are supported via the WEB UI but also the USB interface will automatically detect new software when a USB storage device is inserted. The update will be accomplished without interfering with the existing configuration. The latest software will continuously be available for download from an FTP server hosted by Kongsberg. Wheel mark When used for type approved applications the MFD must be used. The SeaPos is delivered with a 7’’ MFD  (MFD 307 panel computer) that is connected to the SeaPos via LAN. The MFD 307 is made for flush mount, but a variation of brackets can optionally be delivered. GNSS NAVIGATION SENSORS The SeaPos 300 series navigation sensors features type approved instruments for use on-board SOLAS vessels. All sensors are designed for integration with other navigation equipment, and will as default be configured and operated from an ECDIS without the need for separate external displays. The sensors are tested and approved in accordance with international regulations, and have the Wheelmark certification.']\n",
