TYPE APPROVED COMPASS
FOR SHIPS AND HIGH-SPEED CRAFTS
0575
The MGC R2 COMPASS system is IMO type approved as a gyro compass for navigation purposes for use together
with a heading and bearing repeater. Very high reliability is achieved by using Ring Laser Gyros with no rotational or
mechanical wear-out parts.
Typical applications Digital I/O protocols
The system can be operated as an inertial navigation MGC data is available through both Ethernet interface and
system as well as a gyro compass with output of position serial lines enabling easy distribution of data to multiple
and heading. Linear position and velocity measurements users on board the vessel. Output protocols for commonly
can then be output in up to four different points on the used equipment are available on five individually
vessel. configurable serial lines and five Ethernet/UDP ports.

TOPAS PS40 is designed for sub-bottom profiling with very high spatial resolution in water depths from less
than 4 metres to >2,000 metres. The +80% relative bandwidth, low frequency signal is generated in the
water column by non-linear interaction between two high frequency signals (centred symmetrically around
40 kHz). Similarly a sum frequency signal is also generated. However, only the low frequency signal is used
for sub-bottom profiling.
System specification: cient survey time and higher positioning accuracy for the profile.
