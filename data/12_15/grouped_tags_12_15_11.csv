While the oil-filled dome solved the O-ring flooding failures, it introduced beam defocusing in two conditions, warm & shallow and cold & deep. The beam defocusing effect becomes more extreme in warm shallow water as temperature increases and cold deep water as depth increases. Until now, there has been no solution to this problem, aside from using a high-resolution scanning sonar head.'}","{'heading': 'Innovative Lens Technology', 'text': 'Our engineers solved this problem by designing a patented acoustic lens that maintains beam focus through operational temperature and depth changes, significantly improving sonar performance and resulting in images that are much sharper. The Clariscan acoustic lens behaves like an optical contact lens, correcting the refraction caused by the oil in the dome. Clariscan is currently available in a 4000M depth-rated version.'}","{'heading': 'Applications', 'text': 'Obstacle avoidance, Pipeline survey, Target detection, and Underwater construction support are key applications of the Clariscan domed scanning sonar. Deep water testing in the Gulf of Mexico clearly showed the difference in image quality between the Clariscan sonar head and the standard domed sonar with composite transducer.

This measure, however, is directly applicable only in the farfield. The intensity of a sound wave is related to the pressure level and can be calculated using the relation I = p2/ρc. The source level is given by SL = 170.8 + 10lgP + DI, where P is the acoustic power and DI is the transducer’s directivity index. The nearfield limit is conventionally given by R = L2/λ, and the pressure levels in the nearfield can be derived from the source level of an echo sounder by calculating the pressure level at the largest farfield limit and adjusting for distance to the transducer.'}","{'heading': 'Pressure Level Calculations', 'text': 'In the nearfield, the pressure level will be nominally constant as there is no spreading, and if the transmit transducer is rectangular, there will be a transition region with cylindrical spreading. The maximum possible pressure level can be estimated based on the maximum acoustic power intensity that can be applied to a transducer to avoid cavitation. The calculations outlined are for the on-axis direction, and off-axis, the pressure level will fall rapidly for a narrow beam.

Different species swim at different speeds, hence knowing the trawl's speed through water versus the vessel's GPS speed is crucial for efficient fishery. The flow through the net can be influenced by a multitude of factors such as tide, currents, and the net's physical properties. The Simrad PX Flow sensor delivers real-time information, allowing for adjustments in vessel speed to maintain the correct towing speed and adapt to the target species.""}","{'heading': 'Wireless Catch Monitoring', 'text': 'The Simrad PX Flow sensor is a versatile, wireless multifunction catch monitoring sensor that measures the speed of water at the trawl opening or inside the trawl. This sensor differentiates itself by using a small built-in acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP), which employs the Doppler principle to measure water speed at a distance from the net—vital for accuracy in areas like a trawl tunnel where water speed decreases closer to the net.'}","{'heading': 'Multiple Measurement Capabilities', 'text': 'Out of the box, the PX Flow sensor provides four different measurements and, with an additional license, it can measure up to eight parameters including Flow, Geometry, Height, Roll, Pitch, Battery level, Depth, and Temperature.

It is mainly designed for smaller fishing vessels and offers the latest technology available, previously found only on larger sonars and other acoustic systems.'}","{'heading': 'Compact Design for Ease of Installation', 'text': 'The compact size and ease of installation makes the Simrad SY50 ideal for vessels with limited room for a sonar installation. There is no transceiver cabinet, only a small power supply. All the transceiver electronics are contained inside the transducer, resulting in less cables, less noise, and easier setup. The communication between the hull unit and the computer on the bridge is limited to a single Ethernet cable. Moreover, both the hull unit and the computer may also operate on DC power, which is perfect for coastal fishing vessels without a 3-phase power system on-board.'}","{'heading': 'Advanced Sonar Capabilities', 'text': ""The SY50 uses 256 individual receiver- and transmitter channels to offer a clear and high-resolution sonar presentation, unparalleled in a sonar in this price range. This includes full beam stabilisation, vertical views, FM transmission, and single-ping transmission that covers horizontal and vertical in one ping. The popular 'Winson' operating software, with familiar user interface available in almost 20 languages, makes the SY50 incredibly user-friendly.""}","{'heading': 'Efficient and Customizable Operation', 'text': 'The cylindrical multi-element transducer of the SY50 allows for omnidirectional sonar beams to be tilted electronically from +10 to -60° in 1° steps facilitating automatic tracking of fish schools. Built-in stabilization is available for electronic pitch and roll compensation with external sensor connectivity for enhanced accuracy. Users can also define and save their specific settings for efficient operation, while the optional small operating panel simplifies basic operating features, communicating with the computer through a single USB cable.'}","• Small and compact, fits even on smaller fishing vessels

1) Accuracy is in X and Y direction
2) Range capability is depending on line of sight, transponder's transmit power setting, vessel's acoustic system and influence of ambient noise and ray bending.
3) Operational coverage defines the sector where acoustic positioning and communications are operational. Main Coverage is the sector where maximum range and angular accuracy can be achieved. Outside the main coverage range and elevation angular accuracy are reduced, therefore a depth input for aiding is recommended
