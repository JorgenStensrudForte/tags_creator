You can set up all necessary parameters related to \"wakeup\" and \"sleep\" times for the echo sounder, as well as transmission modes, intervals, and other parameters.After you have planned the deployment carefully, all settings are uploaded to the transceiver. In addition to running a predefine schedule, you can first use the EK Mission Planner to define the ping configurations and send these to the instrument. Then you can use the \"interactive mode\" (or \"command mode\" if you like) to control the transmissions from an external source such as an onboard controller. \"Interactive mode\" also enables the reading of key information such as mean volume backscattering strength in layers in real-time.

The next step is to define ping groups, i.e. all parameters for a ping, such as CW (Continuous Wave) versus FM (Frequency Modulated), pulse duration, transmit power, and so on. The third step is to define the duration of the deployment which can be divided into several phases. Usually, it\\'s sufficient to use only one single phase. The last step in the mission planning is to put the ping groups you defined into ensembles. You can choose if the ensembles shall be repeated for a fixed number of iterations or for as many times as possible within the time span you choose. After planning the mission, you can set the environmental parameters. After completing these steps, you are ready to connect to the transceiver, send the mission plan to the transceiver and deploy. \\n End-user documentation\\nCurrent software version\\nJoin the Ocean Science mailing list!\\nControl of all necessary parameters needed to\\xa0 program a mission plan\\nThe mission plan is set by programming in Ping Groups, Ping Group Libraries, Phases, and Ensembles\\nLicense-free software\\nOcean observatories\\nFish migration studies\\nLong-term biological studies\\nImproved fish stock assessment\\nWater column profiling\\nEK80 software\\nWBAT\\nWBT Mini\\nOcean Science products contact informationQuestions or comments?\\nWhere to buy Simrad productsIf you want to purchase Simrad equipment you can rely on a world wide sales organization.\\nJoin us on Facebook\\nFollow us on Twitter\\nVisit us on LinkedIn', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/situational-awareness/proximityview/': 'With the combination of precisely calibrated cameras, inertial positioning and SeaAware sensor interpretation, we are able to provide the user with precise information to assist in these most difficult of maneuvers.

The PX Configurator can also be used to calibrate the trawl doors on a remote place where there is no other calibration utility available, like for example the TV80.Catch monitoring sensors are delivered from Simrad readily set up with common default settings. In some cases, you may find that the default parameters do not suit your operational needs. This is for example if you have more than one sensor of any given type. The decision to configure a sensor is one you must make depending on how many sensors you use, and how many of these are identical. Dedicated dialog boxes are provided to configure the new sensor.Note: The PX Configurator only allows you to configure PX sensors.

In the largest window of the display you can clearly see the trawl opening and the bottom. The view on the left side shows the echogram from one of the built-in echo sounders. On the right-hand side, you can see information from the catch monitoring sensors in use.System descriptionThe FM90 has a fast refresh rate that allows you to view the sonar images in real time. The FM90 enables use of your existing PI/PX catch monitoring sensors. It operates equally well in the water column and close to the bottom.The FM90 Multibeam Trawl Sonar offers many advantages over conventional mechanically-scanning trawl sonars in most applications. However, it is not a complete replacement in some applications. We recommend the FM90 mainly for surface, pelagic, and semi-pelagic trawling on soft bottom. For bottom trawling and trawling on hard bottom we recommend the FS70 Trawl Sonar.The FM90 Sonar communicates with the vessel by means of a third-wire system using very high bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL2) communication, transmitting real-time images of the net opening at rapid refresh rates. In addition, an echo sounder looking up (\"up sounder\") monitors fish escaping over the net, while another echo sounder shows the foot-rope, the sea bottom, and the fish entering the net.By means of the submerged Trawl Unit, the FM90 communicates with a number of Simrad PI/PX 40 kHz catch monitoring sensors by means of hydroacoustic links. Up to six measurements can be made simultaneously. Standard pitch, roll, depth, and temperature sensors are also built in to the Trawl Unit.The FM90 is a solid-state sonar system. This design eliminates moving parts, and increases reliability and availability during fishing operations. The FM90 is backed by the product warranty and global service network offered by Simrad.The FM90 is a unique sonar, both in design and functionality. When the FM90 sonar pings, it sends out sound energy in a 240-degree sector. This energy is reflected from the net, from fish, and from other targets in the water column. The reflected energy is received by the transducer, processed, and shown on the display. Because the FM90 pings across a wide area in one ping, the refresh rate to generate a picture of the net opening is almost instantaneous. This gives you real-time images, allowing you to adjust to very fast movements of fish schools.The FM90 uses an updated version of Kongsberg Mesotech\\'s tried and tested M3 Sonar® multibeam processing software, successfully deployed world-wide for many years. The software uses innovative processing algorithms to automatically optimize the image quality specifically for fishing applications. It includes FM transmissions (also known as \"Chirp\") to ensure a clutter-free picture with a very high resolution in range.The FM90 Processor Unit is controlled by the Microsoft® Windows® operating system. This allows for a flexible choice of presentation modes, and for a large range of user applications.System diagramThe system diagram identifies the main components of a basic FM90 system, as well as the connections between the units.

The Power/VDSL Unit must be mounted on top of the bridge console or recessed and flush mounted into the bridge console.Trawl UnitThe Trawl Unit is made up of several components, including the Sonar Head, enclosed in a Deployment Pack.In addition to the FM90 Sonar Head, the Trawl Unit includes the third-wire extension whip and hydrophone(s). Mounting shackles on the Deployment Pack aid in attaching the Trawl Unit to the net. An access panel provides easy access to the third-wire whip and strain-relief block, minimizing the need to open the Deployment Pack.The Trawl Unit contains an aft-looking catch hydrophone to communicate with your catch monitoring sensors. An optional forward-looking PI hydrophone communicates with sensors mounted on the trawl door, if you have any.

It is designed for the professional fishery community. The latest innovations in computer technology have been used to satisfy the increasing needs from our demanding customers: \"Top performance at any depth, and easy to operate!\"The ES70 screen capture shows the echogram provided by a Simrad ES38 split-beam transducer. An area of the echogram has been zoomed in. Additional information panes are used to reveal fish position and size distribution.The Simrad ES70 is a modular system, the basic configuration consists of a computer, a transceiver and a transducer. Using this basic configuration you can start with a simple single frequency single beam system. Later, you can expand the system to a multi-frequency echo sounder using single and/or split-beam transducers. You can choose from a wide variety of advanced software functions, transducers, and transceivers.Multiple frequencies are available for the Simrad ES70. This is because different frequencies and transducers are used for different fisheries. Mackerel, Tuna, Anchovies, Herring and other schooled fish are best measured using a high frequency system, typically 120 or 200 kHz depending on the depth. Cod, Pollock, Seith and other bottom fish can be measured using 70 or 38 kHz systems, while 18 kHz is used for deep water species. Any two of the available frequencies can be assembled in the same transceiver cabinet. Each frequency is operated separately as with individual echo sounders, orsimultaneously to see the frequency response from the fish on two different frequencies. You can add up to a total of six frequencies on the screen at the same time, or on separate monitors, using available software, computer technology and display monitors.With the Simrad ES70, Simrad introduces a new way to present optional information. We call them information panes. With a click on the requested icon on the top bar, the information you wish to add to the echogram is presented in a dedicated frame. You can place the frame wherever you want, and you can change it to any size and shape. It is even transparent, so you will not loose any information from the echogram behind it.The new zoom function provided by the Simrad ES70 is innovative, efficient and very easy to use. Using the trackball you can establish an area on the echogram. The information within this area is displayed in the Zoom pane, and the fish biomass is calculated and displayed. The zoomed area can be used to investigate a school of pelagic fish, or an area close to bottom. \\n State of the art echo sounder for professional and semi-professional users\\nHigh resolution - high accuracy\\nZoom function with biomass information\\nBottom hardness\\nInnovative display gain functionality\\nSeamless automatic range\\nAutomatic pulse length adjustment\\nUnlimited number of personal settings\\nFast and easy operation\\nImproved bottom detection functionality\\n24 hours “on-screen” history\\nMenu system in multiple languages\\nUp to six frequencies shown simultaneously\\nOptimized for wide screen displays (16:9)\\nWhere to buy Simrad productsIf you want to purchase Simrad equipment you can rely on a world wide sales organization.\\nSupport Simrad ProductsThe \"Simrad\" brand name is owned by Kongsberg Maritime.

We made no compromises during the design of the ST90. Our goal was to make the ultimate high-performance fish-finding sonar. With the Simrad ST90, we use lower frequencies than the SX90 and SU90 sonars. To achieve this, a completely new transducer was designed. Each transducer element is larger than the SX90 and SU90 elements, but the number of elements is the same as the SU90. This high number of elements allows for the same narrow beam and a longer range. The ST90 has been designed to search with very long ranges in all weather and sea conditions. Whether it is heavy weather, hard bottom, open waters, weak targets - all echoes are handled by the sonar due to the fully stabilized and very narrow beams combined with the cutting edge signal processing.The centre operational frequency is 19 kHz, but you can select any operational frequency from 14 to 24 kHz in steps of 1 kHz. The cylindrical multi-element transducer allows the omnidirectional sonar beams to be tilted electronically from -10 to +84 degrees. These features allow you to track schools of fish automatically and to observe the whole water volume around the vessel.The narrow beam opening angle (6.5° @ 17 kHz) and the high source level makes the ST90 a very powerful and high resolution low frequency sonar. The narrow beams provided by the ST90 give you several advantages.They increase the range and resolution and offer a vertical view with additional details and a clearer picture.They make the ST90 even more ideal when you need to search for fish close to the sea bottom, or close to the surface, at long ranges.They provide a far better vertical view with less \"bottom climbing\" than what is seen on sonars with a wider beam.The narrow beams also decrease the noise level.It is common for sonars to require many pings to build the various views in the echo presentation. These sonars may, for example, need one ping to build the 360 degrees omni view and then several other pings to fetch the echoes for the vertical views. On the ST90, all the sonar views in the presentation are built using the echoes from one single ping.

This design means fewer cables, less noise and easier installation.The hull unit can be placed on an installation trunk with a diameter of only eight inches. The height of the trunk and the length of the transducer shaft can be adjusted to fit the size of the vessel.The transducer can be lowered to 40 or 60 centimetres below the hull.The centre operational frequency is 57 kHz, but you can select any operational frequency from 54 to 60 kHz in steps of 0.5 kHz. This frequency range gives you an operating range of up to 2,000 metres depending on the acoustic conditions.The cylindrical multi-element transducer allows the omnidirectional sonar beams to be tilted electronically from +10 to -60° in 1° steps. This function lets you automatically track schools of fish and observe the whole water volume around the vessel. A built-in stabilising system is included for electronic pitch and roll compensation, but you can connect to an external sensor for improved accuracy.The compact size and ease of installation make the Simrad SY50 ideal for vessels with little room for a sonar installation. There is no transceiver cabinet, only a small power supply. All the transceiver electronics are contained inside the transducer.The communication between the hull unit and the computer on the bridge is limited to a single Ethernet cable. Both the hull unit and the computer may also operate on DC power. This option makes the SY50 a perfect choice for coastal fishing vessels with no 3-phase power system on board. Using 256 individual receiver- and transmitter channels, the SY50 offers a clear and high-resolution sonar presentation, which was not previously seen on any sonar in this price range. Our well-known \"large sonar\" functions include full beam stabilisation, vertical views, FM transmission, and single-ping transmission (horizontal and vertical in one ping). The popular \"Winson\" operating software known from all Simrad products is used. With the familiar user interface available in almost 20 languages, the SY50 is exceptionally easy to use.The SY50 is provided with a small and compact computer. This computer does not contain any fans or other moving parts. It can safely be installed and used in a humid environment.To simplify the basic operating features, we can provide a small operating panel. This panel is smaller than the other panels we have. It is easy to install among other equipment on a populated control desk. The operating panel communicate with the computer using a single USB cable.The hull unit power must always be turned onIt is crucial that the power to the SY50 hull unit is alwaysturned on, even when the sonar is not in use. If the power is turned off, the force of gravity may cause the transducer to be inadvertently lowered. The sonar has a safety function that will automatically hoist the transducer if unexpected problems arise. This function prevents the transducer from being lowered when the sonar is not used, but the power must be turned on. \\n Data sheets\\nSystem diagram\\nTechnical specifications\\nCurrent software version\\nEnd-user documentation and installation drawings\\nNetCDF Scientific output\\nOrder information\\nSY50 and SY50C Hull units\\nTransducer\\nNISE 3900E Sonar processor unit\\nSmall and compact, fits even on smaller fishing vessels\\nEasy to install\\n10 metres transducer cable\\n360 degrees omnidirectional\\nThe operating frequency is adjustable from 55 to 59 kHz\\nOperating range up to 2000 metres\\nCW and FM pulse forms\\nTilt from +10 to -60°\\nNarrow beams\\nLarge dynamic range\\nHigh definition\\nStabilised by the internal sensor, can connect to an external motion reference unit (MRU)\\nEasy operation\\nStore and recall sonar data\\nDefine and save your own user settings\\nClear and easily comprehensive sonar data presentations\\n256 transceiver channels\\nJoin the SY50 mailing list!\\nThe transceiver electronics have been placed inside the cylindrical transducer.

Transmission is made by a dedicated projector array, normally of the same length as the multibeam projector and mounted parallel to this. The SBP 120/300 shares receiver array with the EM.Deeper penetrationThe SBP 120/300 Sub bottom profiler has a much narrower beam width than a conventional sub bottom profiler with correspondingly lesser smearing. It thus provides deeper penetration into the bottom, and higher angular resolution. Compared to the other class of narrow beam SBPs: the parametric sediment profilers, a significantly higher source level can be produced by the large transmitter array of the SBP 120. This enables better penetration into the sediments.Stabilised for ships attidudeThe transmit beam and the receiver beams are stabilised for pitch and roll, respectively.Several simultaneous beamsThe receiver beam former have access to the digitized individual hydrophone signals of the receiver array. This is utilized to generate several beams per ping providing the SBP 120 with the unique feature of being a true multibeam sub bottom profiler.Integration with EM 124/304The sub bottom profiler is tightly integrated with the EM 124/304 multibeam echo sounder:It makes use of the same receiver array and preamplifier as the EM. The EMs preamplifier is filtering the received signals into a high frequency channel used by the EM and a low frequency (2-8 kHz) channel that is used by the SBP.It uses the water depth measured by the EM for automatic setting of the observation window.If the bottom is sloping, the EM can estimate the local slope angles and inform the SBP 120, so that the beams can be directed perpendicularly to the bottom, in order to get the best resolution and contrastPinging can be synchronized so that interference is minimized.

All these features results in very high spatial resolution in the sediment profiles. The narrow beam also results in lower received reverberation levels and thus higher penetration.Profiler optionsThe PS 18 system can, as an option, use the low frequency channels of the EM 122 multibeam echo sounder receiver array, as input. In this case an additional multi channel receiver unit including beamformer is installed. The narrow receiver beam for the EM 122 system improves signal-to-noise ratio and increases performance of the TOPAS system.All TOPAS systems can receive slope information from KONGSBERG multibeam echo sounders to steer the beam perpendicular to the seabed for better performance.

In tight collaboration with Forsvarets Forskninsinstitutt (FFI), Norwegian Space Agency (NOSA) and European Space Agency (ESA), Kongsberg has continuously improved our AIS technology and we have a range of innovative AIS space-based payloads. Highest decoder performance, multi-antenna support, low power, miniaturized housing, large mass memory, solid lifetime and failure free heritage are some of the features. Though innovative technology we achieve leading end-to-end performance, where the superior sensitivity and algorithms of the ASRs makes the receivers capable of detecting even AIS class B vessels. Reconfigurable software-defined radio (SDR) technology is used, enabling support for future enhancements in algorithms or changes in AIS/VDES standards.Vessel detection performance to the next levelKongsberg started working with AIS twenty years ago and is the AIS equipment manufacturer with the broadest experience. The two latest products, ASR c50 and x50, are Kongsberg’s 4th generation AIS Space Receivers and builds on this foundation of expertise. A multiple set of decollision algorithms is optimised for best possible vessel detection in high-density and medium-density areas. Our ASRs will give the end user a giant leap in vessel detection compared with existing SAT-AIS receivers.ApplicationsPrimary or secondary payload on nano or micro satellites\\xa0for LEOSecondary payload on SAR and larger earth observation\\xa0satellites \\n Primary or secondary payload on nano or micro satellites\\xa0for LEO\\nSecondary payload on SAR and larger earth observation\\xa0satellites', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/onshore/space-based/vdes-space-transceivers/': ' \\n ', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/bridge-systems-and-control-centres/navigation-systems/ais-automatic-identification-sensor/': 'IMO requirementIn accordance with IMO requirements all SOLAS ships in international traffic above 300 gross tons must have an Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) installed onboard.

In addition, water currents, corrosion, and damage from storms and vessels may impact structure integrity. Diving inspections can be costly and dangerous due to a lack of visibility, plus inconsistencies in data reporting are common.\\nDiving inspections are often challenged by high current, deep water, lack of visibility, and debris accumulation around the structure. In addition to limiting the diver from completing a thorough inspection, debris build-up around bridge piers is potentially one of the most dangerous conditions the inspection diver faces. It introduces the possibility of entanglement, and even worse, diver entrapment if the debris moves.High-resolution scanning sonar provides high-definition images. Also, the compact size and portability of the equipment enables quick, frequent monitoring.\\nA tripod or ROV-deployed high-resolution sonar provides a stable platform for shipwreck analysis. The advantage of using a high-resolution sonar to document shipwrecks is deployment at multiple positions around the wreckage to obtain the best geometric coverage and to detail specific areas of interest. For salvage operations, the sonar can monitor divers or the position of rigging in real-time.\", 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/multibeam-echo-sounders/em-2040-phs-portable-hydrographic-system-/': \"Decades of experience and expertise are embedded in both the EM 2040 and Seapath systems. Together they form an unmatched out-of-the-box solution based on proven and de facto industry standard KONGSBERG technology.Pole connection diagram including the transducer, EM2040 processing unit and Seapath position, attitude, time and heading sensor. The Pole design shown is for illustration purpose only. Actual product may vary due to product enhancement.Flexibility and portability are paramount to the EM 2040 PHS. It is stored and transported in hardened, easy to carry cases. The integrated nature of the system reduces installation, calibration and set-up time, without compromise to bathymetric performance. Pre-alignment of the MRU and the SV probe, together with single cable connection enables rapid deployment with the included mounting package.Additionally, with the opportunity to utilise any type of KONGSBERG Motion Reference Unit (MRU), varying demands in heave/roll/pitch accuracy are met, adding even more flexibility for diverse projects and vessels.EM 2040P Multibeam echo sounderThe EM 2040P is a shallow water multibeam echo sounder based on the cutting-edge KONGSBERG EM 2040 technology platform. It is highly portable, and has been designed for easy transport and quick deployment on any vessel, while offering survey performance up to and exceeding the IHO-S44 special order and the more stringent LINZ specification. It is ideal for diverse applications, from high resolution mapping and inspection to shallow water surveys.The EM2040 P processing unit.The EM 2040P is KONGSBERG's newest, most advanced shallow water multibeam echo sounder. Like all KONGSBERG multibeam echo sounders, motion, position and sound velocity measurements are used to compensate for dynamic environmental and platform effects as the data is acquired. The system also employs advanced bottom tracking and data cleaning algorithms during acquisition.These two practices result in extremely clean bathymetry data that requires minimal or no data cleaning once imported, which dramatically reduces the time needed for post-processing. While these corrections are made automatically during acquisition, all of the raw data is preserved in the datagram format, thus allowing the user to go back and make changes in parameters such as SVP or system offsets during post processing if required.EM 2040 transducer, front and rear view.Frequency of the system is user selectable between 200, 300 and 400 kHz. At 200 kHz the EM 2040P range and swath width is maximised, while the 400 kHz frequency provides higher resolution. Frequency can be manually selected to avoid acoustic interference with other sonar devices.The EM 2040P incorporates many advanced KONGSBERG deep water multibeam technology in a shallow water system, including:Dual Swath capability with 100% alongtrack coverage within a ping, allowing ample sounding density alongtrack at high survey speedsFM (Frequency Modulated) transmit pulses for better range, greater coverage, less noise and higher resolution in deeper watersComplete electronic roll and pitch stabilisationYaw stabilisation in real time (only KONGSBERG shallow water multibeam echo sounders support this capability)Near field focusing on both transmit and receiveMultiple transmit sectors to suppress multi-path interferenceExtra detections utilises phase and amplitude information to generate up to 10 extra soundings per beam, sorted into 7 classes, visualising objects in the water columnSeapath 130 SeriesThe Seapath 130 series is developed specifically for portable hydrographic surveying work where high precision heading, position, roll, pitch, heave and timing are critical measurements. It combines state-of-the-art dual frequency GNSS receivers, inertial technology and processing algorithms in a compact and portable package.Easy installationThe main component is the Sensor Unit for top mounting, with the integrated GNSS antennas and receivers. On top of the transducer the inertial sensor (MRU) of choice is mounted within a light weight subsea housing. Connecting a laptop (PC) gives access to the Seapath software for configuration and monitoring.Available modelsSeapath 130-3 with MRU 3 to 0.08° roll and pitch accuracySeapath 130-H with MRU H to 0.03° roll and pitch accuracySeapath 130-5 with MRU 5 to 0.02° roll and pitch accuracySeapath 130-5+ with MRU 5+ to 0.008° roll and pitch accuracyA unique solutionThe advanced Seapath navigation algorithms integrate RTK GNSS data with the inertial sensor data from the MRU. This gives the Seapath 130 unique advantages compared to stand-alone RTK products.Seapath's accurate roll, pitch and heading measurements allow the RTK antenna position to be referenced to any point on the vessel where accurate position and velocity are required. All data are provided with a time stamp and the output is in real-time. Subdecimetre position accuracy can be achieved through downloadable satellite orbit and clock data, and by post processing of satellite and IMU data.Enhanced stability, accuracy and availability is obtained as Seapath take advantages of both GPS and GLONASS. Continuous calculation for every possible differential solution with e.g. IALA, WAAS, Fugro Seastar XP2/G2 and RTK are provided, and Seapath outputs a best current position, weighing the stability and accuracy of each constellation.These solutions yield accuracies down to 1 cm in the horizontal and 2 cm in the vertical plane.

The EM 304 MKII can map the shallow-to-medium water depths with high resolution and still map the deepest depths with a superior coverage. Compared to the EM 304 MKI, the MKII has an increase of 75% swath performance at 6000m.MODULAR AND FLEXIBLE DESIGNThe EM 304 MKII uses state-of-the-art electronics and separate transmit and receive transducers in a Mills Cross configuration. It utilizes the same field-proven electronics and transducers from the EM 304 MKI/EM 302, making it easy to upgrade.The design is highly modular and flexible with compact electronics for easier and faster installation. The flexible transducer design makes it possible to tailor the system to almost any required size.Ultimate system performance – resolution and range – is achieved with the largest standard size, 0.3 x 0.5 degrees, whereas the smaller 4 x 4 degrees solution can be installed on any vessel of opportunity.Acoustic ice protection windows can be offered for vessels going to the ice rand and for ice breakers. Both TX and RX ice windows are made of hyperlast, reinforced with titanium rods, proven to withstand surveys across the North Pole.FULL SEABED COVERAGEThe transmit fan can be divided into 16 individual sectors in dual swath mode. This allows for unique control of the transmit fan, enabling active stabilization in real time to correct for any yaw and pitch movement of the vessel, while roll stabilization is applied on the receiving beams. The result is a stabilized system—full ensonification of the seabed with an equally distributed footprint in all types of weather conditions, leaving no gaps or holes in the mapped area. All beams are maintained and automatically adjusted according to achievable coverage or operator defined limits. Up to 1600 individual beams are available in dual swath mode. The two individual transmitting fans are generated with a small difference in tilt to provide a constant sounding separation along track, resulting in a dense sounding pattern on the seafloor.CLEAN AND HIGH RESOLUTION DATADue to the sector transmission technique, the system produces a strong dampening of multi-bounce interference from false echo, resulting in significantly cleaner data. Near field beam focus is applied in real time, both during transmission and reception. Due to sector transmission, the focal point will be individual for each sector, resulting in a much sharper transmit beam over the entire swath. On reception, the focus is done dynamically for each beam. The result is a much higher resolution representation of the seabed.THE KONGSBERG EM SYSTEMSThe EM 304 MKII is part of the new EM platform designed for future challenges and uses the new KMALL datagram format. The format supports several new features, such as extended backscatter calibration, with more features in continuous development. The new platform is supported by Kognifai, KONGSBERG's open digital ecosystem, bringing opportunities to transform survey operations through digitalization.Like all KONGSBERG EM multibeam echo sounders, the EM 304 MKII ensures the best operating environment to safeguard marine life inhabiting the survey area through the option to decrease emitted sound levels.FeaturesModular designHigh resolutionWide frequency rangeFM chirpRoll, pitch, and yaw stabilizationShort pulse lengths, large bandwidthTransmit and receive nearfield focusingWater column display and loggingWater column phase loggingSeabed imageDual swathExtra detectionsMammal protectionRealtime SoftwareSeafloor Information System - SISPost Processing softwareQPS Qimera - advanced multibeam bathymetry processing softwareQPS Fledermaus - 4D geo-spatial processing and analysis toolEiva NaviSuite NaviEdit and NaviModelTeledyne CARIS HIPS/SIPS post processingGeocap Seafloor integrated with Neptune for digital terrain modellingNote: KONGSBERG is not responsible for any system malfunction caused by 3rd party software. \\n Modular design\\nHigh resolution\\nWide frequency range\\nFM chirp\\nRoll, pitch, and yaw stabilization\\nShort pulse lengths, large bandwidth\\nTransmit and receive nearfield focusing\\nWater column display and logging\\nWater column phase logging\\nSeabed image\\nDual swath\\nExtra detections\\nMammal protection\\nSeafloor Information System - SIS\\nQPS Qimera - advanced multibeam bathymetry processing software\\nQPS Fledermaus - 4D geo-spatial processing and analysis tool\\nEiva NaviSuite NaviEdit and NaviModel\\nTeledyne CARIS HIPS/SIPS post processing\\nGeocap Seafloor integrated with Neptune for digital terrain modelling\", 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/es_bottommapping/EA400-600/': 'Advantages to our side scan echo sounderOnly one set of equipment for depth sounding and imaging is neededEase of operation: no towed bodiesDigital recording of side scan echo sounder imagesExcellent image qualityClick in the image area and export the data to the networkDual 120 kHz with 200 kHz depth soundingSingle 200 kHz with 38 kHz bottom detector lineSingle side scan with 200 kHz - wreck detection \\n Only one set of equipment for depth sounding and imaging is needed\\nEase of operation: no towed bodies\\nDigital recording of side scan echo sounder images\\nExcellent image quality\\nClick in the image area and export the data to the network', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/es_bottommapping/EA440/': 'KEY FEATURESThe EA440 is a high precision hydrographic echo sounder.Multiple applications depth observations, side scan and sub-bottom lightUp to eight simultaneous channelsFrequencies from 38 kHz to 500 kHzSub-bottom functionality at 15 kHzCW/FM pulse formsEasy to install on Windows computersRoll, pitch and heave compensationTrue raw data loggingWorld-class bottom detectionSYSTEM SOFTWAREThe EA440 will continuously be updated on a regular basis.

By using two different frequencies, the system will provide both accurate bottom depth and penetration information depend of sediment concentration.Both depth and bottom profileThis compact, multichannel echo sounder can simultaneously monitor both depth and bottom profile.Customer benefits of an echo sounder sweep systemThe EA MCU echo sounder sweep system has several advantages including:Bottom detection capabilities specially suited for use in shallow waterConsistent and accurate data over an entire sweepReplay of raw dataIs simple to configure the x,y and z coordinates of the transducers.Transducer mode, parameter and display settings, to be stored in the computer’s hard drive.Storing of real time sound velocity (SVP) smart sensorA variety of usesDetecting and locating debris or other hazards to navigation in harbours, rivers or canals so that they may be removedMonitoring the charted safe depth of navigable waterwaysSurveying shallow inland bodies of water, estuaries, marsh or tidal areasMonitoring dredging or underwater construction operationsMonitoring silt build-up or shifting bottom topography for commercial or environmental studies \\n Bottom detection capabilities specially suited for use in shallow water\\nConsistent and accurate data over an entire sweep\\nReplay of raw data\\nIs simple to configure the x,y and z coordinates of the transducers.\\nTransducer mode, parameter and display settings, to be stored in the computer’s hard drive.\\nStoring of real time sound velocity (SVP) smart sensor\\nDetecting and locating debris or other hazards to navigation in harbours, rivers or canals so that they may be removed\\nMonitoring the charted safe depth of navigable waterways\\nSurveying shallow inland bodies of water, estuaries, marsh or tidal areas\\nMonitoring dredging or underwater construction operations\\nMonitoring silt build-up or shifting bottom topography for commercial or environmental studies', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/es_bottommapping/single-beam-echosounder-ea400/': ' \\n ', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/es_bottommapping/survey-single-beam-echo-sounder-ea400/': ' \\n ', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/es_bottommapping/portable-single-beam-echo-sounder-ea400sp/': ' \\n ', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/es_bottommapping/ea640/': 'KEY FEATURESThe EA640 is a high precision hydrographic echo sounderUp to eight simultaneous channelsFrequencies from 10 kHz to 500 kHzDeep water frequencies 12 and 18 kHzCW/FM pulse formsEasy to install on Windows®computersRoll, pitch and heave compensationTrue raw data loggingWorld class bottom detectionSYSTEM SOFTWAREThe EA640 will continuously be updated on a regular basis.

HISAS is a wideband SAS sonar with frequency range of 70-100kHz, capable of producing ultra high resolution acoustic images as well as co-registered bathymetry. The sonar is tightly integrated with the INS navigation and motion sensing platform of the HUGIN AUV, and makes use of modern signal processing such as DPCA (Displaced Phase Centre Analysis) to process the raw data into images.4 cm resolutionThe synthetic aperture sonar prototype has recently been tested with success at sea outside Horten, Norway, with signal processing done by Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI). The image above is from this test and shows a sunken wreck standing upright on the bottom. It has a resolution of about 4 cm both along track and across, each acoustic beam being processed from 40 consecutive pings. If the reproduction of the image is good, one can observe details such as the wire running from the bow to the top of the mast.Basic conceptsThe azimuth (along-track) resolution of a sonar can be computed as the ratio between the acoustic wavelength and the length of the array. For typical side scan sonars, this ratio is of the order 1:60-1:400 (meaning a resolution of 1 m at 60 and 400 m range, respectively). A longer array will increase this ratio, but fitting such a long array is not always possible or practical on most underwater vehicles. Operation at a higher frequency will increase the ratio, but will at the same time limit the achievable range due to higher absorption. The Synthetic Aperture Sonar principle overcomes these limitations by utilising data from several consecutive pings to synthesize a longer sonar array. A fundamental limitation of SAS systems is that the platform cannot travel further than half the length of the receive array per ping interval (which in turn determines the range). For SAS systems, the maximum range is proportional to the receive array length, and inversely proportional to the platform speed. The theoretical azimuth resolution in SAS is half the length of each element in the receive array, at all ranges. In general, this resolution is not practically achievable, and the practical resolution will be 1.5 – 2 times lower. The range resolution is, as in regular side scan sonars, a function of the bandwidth.Reverberation suppressionThe multi-element transmit array and the programmable transmit waveform generator allows both beam direction and beam coverage to be varied to reduce influence of seabed and sea surface reverberation. Waveform, pulse length and transmit power are fully programmable.Multi-aspect imagingThe small (in wavelengths) element size gives this sensor a wide field of view, facilitating the use of multi-aspect imaging. The principle is illustrated in the illustration below. In practice, the operator can view a continuous \"movie\" of an object seen from different aspect angles. This feature effectively adds another dimension to the data set, and greatly increases the probability of both manual and computerized classification of mine-like objects in cluttered areas.BathymetryHISAS 1030 has two full-length receive arrays on each side of the AUV. They are used to form two SAS images of the same scene with slightly different geometry. This adds considerable robustness to the system, but it also allows very high resolution interferometric processing from SAS data. The specification is for relative bathymetry resolution better than 50x50 cm to full range, but in practice the resolution may be considerably better which will allow 3D imaging of mines and mine-like objects.High resolution velocity measurementSAS image of a barge of size 10 x 3 m. The small rectangular hole, which measures about 30 x 40 cm, is at 60 m range.HISAS can optionally provide a highly accurate measurement of an AUV\\'s displacement (or velocity) in all three dimensions. This measurement can be utilised by an aided inertial navigation system, and will significantly reduce position error growth when absolute position.FOCUS Synthetic Aperture SonarSignal Processing Toolbox FOCUS is a complete SAS post-processing toolbox, delivered with HISAS 1030.

On research vessels, the hydroacoustic system are the main scientific tools. Nothing can disturb the received echoes, as this will make the echo data unusable for the scientists. For this reason, theK-Syncwas developed. It controls the transmission for all the hydroacoustic systems onboard the vessel, synchronizing them in groups by the transmission rate.However, the K-Sync is too powerful for fishing vessels. That is why we developed a similar concept for fishing, the Simrad TU40 Trigger System. This system is dedicated for fishing vessels. You specify a chosen system as \"master\", and the TU40 distributes the transmission control to all other hydroacoustic systems on board.What THE SIMRAD TU40 doesIn this example from a Simrad ES80 echo sounder, compare area (A) with area (D) to see what the Simrad TU40 does.(A) All the hydroacoustic systems on the vessel are synchronized. The echogram is clean and you can identify small fish.(B) Two echo sounders are in operation, but they are not synchronized. You can see that the interference disrupts the echogram, as the number of short pulses increase.(C) Four sonars have been started, but these are not synchronized. The interference is stronger, and it is very difficult to see any targets.(D) All the hydroacoustic systems on the vessel have been turned on. The echogram is completely disrupted with interference, making the echo sounder useless.Basic factsThe TU40 has twelve independent channels. All the channels are isolated, and the unit is compatible with most commercial hydroacoustic equipment, not only with Simrad equipment.The Trigger Unit runs autonomously.\\xa0It is set up from a commercial computer running the TU40 program. This application provides the user interface, which allows you to monitor status, settings, and transmit trigger schedules. Once setup is completed, the TU40 program can be closed. The computer can be disconnected from the Trigger Unit, and even put to other use.Operational principlesWhenever more than one hydroacoustic system is installed on a vessel, interference may occur. To avoid interference, you can either set up one of the hydroacoustic systems as \"master\", or connect all the sonars and/orecho sounders to a common synchronization system. By means of trigger signals, a common synchronization system will provide individual control of each sonar and/or echo soundertransmission (\"ping\") sequence.\"In physics, interference is the phenomenon in which two waves superpose each other to form a resultant wave of greater orlower amplitude. Interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other,either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency. Interference effectscan be observed with all types of waves, for example, light, radio, acoustic, surface water waves or matter waves.\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation), April 2016The TU40 permits each hydroacoustic system to transmit (\"ping\") according to a logic trigger pattern established to avoid interference. This pattern is made by defining one or more hydroacoustic reference systems, and give these transmit priority. Systems operating in the same frequency range are permitted to transmit simultaneously.The Trigger Unit consists of a programmable logic controller (PLC) and other electronic circuitry that provide the synchronized trigger signals. The standard Trigger Unit can control up to 12 hydroacoustic systems.  \\n End-user documentation\\nCurrent software version\\nSystem diagram\\nWhere to buy Simrad productsIf you want to purchase Simrad equipment you can rely on a world wide sales organization.\\nSupport Simrad ProductsThe \"Simrad\" brand name is owned by Kongsberg Maritime.

Providing this information to a Simrad sonar is specifically useful. However, the CP60 uses a standard NMEA datagram, which means that any system on your vessel can benefit from the data.Besides the water current measurements, the CP60 offers a built-in single-beam echo sounder. The beam opening on this transducer element is 27 degrees. This beam opening angle makes it ideal for fish detection higher up in the water column.The CP60 uses the CP200-5C transducer. For maximum measurement accuracy, we strongly recommend connecting a motion reference unit (MRU) to the CP60. If a motion reference unit is unavailable, use a motion sensor to measure roll and pitch. Use a global positioning system (GPS) as a minimum solution.To obtain precision data that are both detailed and correct, it is necessary to align the transducer and measure its location and offset relative to the vessel’s coordinate system. You must calibrate the CP60 system with the CP200-5C transducer before you use it. \\n End-user documentation\\nCurrent software version\\nSystem diagram\\nNise 3900E Processor Unit\\nSimrad CP200-5C\\nOperation\\nOnline help\\nInstallation documents\\nInstallation drawings\\nSales documents\\nCertificates and declarations\\nSoftware release notes\\nInterface specifications\\nCalibrating the current indicator\\nJoin us on Facebook\\nFollow us on Twitter\\nVisit us on LinkedIn\\nWhere to buy Simrad productsIf you want to purchase Simrad equipment you can rely on a world wide sales organization.\\nSupport Simrad ProductsThe \"Simrad\" brand name is owned by Kongsberg Maritime.

This format makes it much easier to post-process the logged data as it contains already calculated latitude, longitude, depth, time and ellipsoidal height. With SIS comes a complete set of documentation in .html format and examples in C++ and Python. These show you how to read theKMallfiles. Software developers will find this useful as it shortens the development time. Licensing optionsFor an overview of the licensing options, see the comparison table (opens in new window).SIS FullThe standard Seafloor Information System (SIS) offers a one-time cost with continuous updates and bug fixes.The stand-alone K-Controller (K-Ctrl) application is included with every EM system. It controls the echo sounder transmissions, the configuration, settings, and filters. The K-Controller controls the EM systems while integrated with third-party acquisition software. It is fully integrated directly with SIS for easy access to system settings and configuration.SIS LogThe SIS Log license option is delivered with every system. It logs data in 10-minute intervals for troubleshooting purposes.Use SIS Log to record short files for our Customer Support department.SIS BasicThe SIS Basic license contains the SIS software package without Geographic Display or gridding.The SIS Basic is a good option if you need integration with third-party software. SIS Basic offers more data monitoring functionality than K-Controller but uses fewer computer resources.SIS OfficeThe SIS Offline license allows you to use SIS offline in your office without connection to a live system.The SIS Office allows you to pre-configure window preferences, set up and test background files, and create line plans before the survey. You can also make plans while another survey is underway and the vessel system is in use. The data can be replayed withPU Replayto review the survey data, which helps train new surveyors before going out in the field.SIS RemoteOne SIS Remote license per SIS installation on the vessel is required. No license is required on the remote computer. The SIS Remote license is an \"add-on\" to a SIS Full or SIS Basic license.Read more about SIS Remote on the dedicated product page.EM® system software featuresThese features are enabled on the EM systems. They are visualized and recorded by the Seafloor Information System (SIS) or your third-party acquisition software.EM® multi-frequency modeThis function enables the multibeam system to change the swath configuration between multibeam pings. This lets you dynamically define the frequency, swath width (coverage) and pulse mode for up to five consecutive pings. By doing this, you generate a true multi-layered dataset.Extra detectionsThis feature allows detections in the water column to be captured in the KMALL format. They can then be put to use in the post-processing process. SelectExtra Detectionto ensure that echoes from any depth points that deviate noticeably from their adjacent depth points are displayed on the screen and logged correctly. This is useful when you survey wrecks. This is because this ensures that, for instance, echoes from a mast are displayed and recorded.High-frequency modeYou can upgrade the EM\\xa02040 series to 600 - 700 kHz mode. This feature offers a larger operational depth range and better resolution in shallow water.This feature is only available for EM\\xa02040 Single RX and EM\\xa02040P.Multifrequency backscatterThe multi-frequency backscatter feature improves high-resolution inspection surveys using different frequencies simultaneously and the backscatter mosaics for seafloor surface characterization. This mode provides up to five frequencies in a single pass by alternating between the frequency modes per ping.This feature is only available for EM\\xa02040 Single RX, Dual RX and EM\\xa02040P.Water column loggingWater column data can be logged to a separate file in the Seafloor Information System (SIS) for easier processing and data management.This feature is only available for EM\\xa0124, EM\\xa0304, EM\\xa0712 and EM\\xa02040 series.Water column phase data loggingWater column phase logging allows you to do your own bottom or target detections more precisely.

Four independent channels can be used as multiple single-beam channels or working together with a split-beam transducer. With the built-in multiplexer, you can also connect two split-beam transducers simultaneously using sequential pinging.The advantage of the WBAT is that you can collect data in a format, and of a quality, that you already know from the Simrad EK80 scientific echo sounder. Regardless of whether the data is collected from the ship sounders, a profiling probe, or other platforms; the echo sounders use the same data format. This means that the data from different sources can be easily integrated. As with the EK80, the WBAT is capable of split-beam operation, which means that it can be calibrated to the same standards and with the same methods as the EK80.Kongsberg Maritime technology has already proven the pressure-rated housing used by the Simrad WBAT, along with the connections and the internal battery.

While the oil-filled dome solved the O-ring flooding failures, it introduced beam defocusing in two conditions, warm & shallow and cold & deep. The beam defocusing effect becomes more extreme in warm shallow water as temperature increases and cold deep water as depth increases. Until now, there has been no solution to this problem, aside from using a high-resolution scanning sonar head.Our engineers solved this problem by designing a patented acoustic lens that maintains beam focus through operational temperature and depth changes, significantly improving sonar performance and resulting in images that are much sharper. The Clariscan acoustic lens behaves like an optical contact lens, correcting the refraction caused by the oil in the dome.Clariscan is currently available in a 4000M depth-rated version.ApplicationsObstacle avoidancePipeline surveyTarget detectionUnderwater construction supportData ComparisonClariscan Sonar vs. Standard Sonar with Composite TransducerDeep water testing in the Gulf of Mexico clearly showed the difference in image quality between the Clariscan sonar head and the standard domed sonar with composite transducer. The two sonar heads were mounted side by side on an ROV and thus exposed to the same temperature, pressure and salinity conditions, and were operated simultaneously during image capture.The three images below clearly show the image quality of the Clariscan sonar (left image) is superior and rivals that of a high-resolution scanning sonar head.Data Comparison 1: Clariscan (left) – Standard sonar with composite transducer (right).Data Comparison 2: Clariscan (left) – Standard sonar with composite transducer (right).Data Comparison 3: Clariscan (left) – Standard sonar with composite transducer (right). \\n Obstacle avoidance\\nPipeline survey\\nTarget detection\\nUnderwater construction support', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/es_bottommapping/RD-301/': \"Alarm settingThe RD 301 echo sounder remote display has it's own alarm setting.

The main emphasis during the development has been a solid theoretical foundation with a stringent mathematical representation to ensure that statistical optimality is maintained throughout the entire system.NAVLAB SIMULATORThe Simulator can simulate any vehicle trajectory in the vicinity of Earth, with a chosen set of sensor measurements.NAVLAB ESTIMATORThe Estimator calculates optimal estimates of a vehicle’s position, orientation and velocity, based on available sensors, such as GPS/acoustic positioning, Doppler velocity log and inertial measurement unit - IMU. It can process data from the Simulator or from a real vehicle.OPTIMAL SMOOTHINGThe Kalman filter is the optimal real-time estimator, but for post-processing the best algorithm is Optimal Smoothing, also benefitting from future measurements. The smoothed estimate of position, attitude and velocity, has several important advantages compared to the real-time solution, such as:The navigation results are more accurate. An example in case of a 2 hours position measurement drop-out, is shown in figure 1. Even in cases where position measurements are continuously available, the position accuracy improves significantly.No measurements are unexpected, and thus there are no jumps in the data (hence the name smoothing). An example is shown in figure 2.Even in cases of sensor degradation or failure, accurate navigation can often be obtained (no need for a new mission). This is due to the increased robustness of the smoothing.The navigation results have maximum reliability (critical sensor errors are detected).When using NavLab with smoothing, lower quality navigation sensors may be used, while still obtaining satisfactory navigational accuracy.CAN NAVLAB BE USED FOR YOUR APPLICATION?NavLab is readily integrated with the KONGSBERG HUGIN AUV and Hydroacoustic Aided Inertial Navigation (HAIN) products, but can due to its modularity easily be adapted to any application as long as raw sensor data are stored. NavLab has accurately positioned AUVs, ROVs, ships and aircrafts.NavLab is always more accurate than a real time navigation system with comparable sensors.Optimal smoothing is the key technology providing maximum accuracy, robustness and integrity.In some applications only real-time navigation results are of interest, however, NavLab is still useful for:Verification of position quality. As an example, the HUGIN AUV or the HAIN navigation data can periodically be verified by NavLab.Tuning of real-time navigation system, and calibration of the sensors. Optimal tuning and correct calibration is determined by NavLab.Mission planning. Vehicle operation and use of navigation sensors to get desired navigation accuracy can be investigated and planned in NavLab simulations.Consideration of acquiring more sensors. The effect of sensor accuracies on resulting navigation performance can be simulated in NavLab.For advanced scientific users, NavLab has been extensively used for navigation system research and development (for which it was originally developed).NAVLAB PROGRAM MODULESNavLab is delivered in 3 different packages with different program modules:NavLab post-processing tool: Preproc, Estimator and ExportNavLab post-processing tool with Simulator: Preproc, Simulator, Estimator and ExportNavLab simulation tool: Simulator, Estimator and ExportPreproc does the necessary pre-processing of recorded data, including automatic outlier removal. In underwater navigation, vertical position is deduced from pressure measurements. NavLab converts pressure measurements to depth using the internationally standardized UNESCO formula. In shallow waters the pressure field is dynamic due to irregular ocean waves. This can cause a dynamic depth sensor error which is observed and filtered by the NavLab Estimator. Export exports the result on a desired format.FLEXIBLE USER INTERFACENavLab comes with a simple user interface with minimal operator interaction for robust and automated navigation data post-processing. In addition, it is also possible for advanced users to control a large amount of parameters and options, to make NavLab solve exactly their specific problems.SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITYNavLab can run under Matlab on any platform or as a stand alone Windows program.THEORETICAL BASIS/TECHNOLOGYNavLab is developed as a general research tool by the Navigation group at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), where the main focus has been a solid theoretical foundation to maintain statistical optimality throughout the system.The performance has been extensively tested through simulations and real data trials. The result is a tool that is very reliable, robust and has a high performance every time it is run.

The same principles of technical innovation and tough build quality have been brought to bear in the expanded functionality of the cNODE Mantis: the addition of a live video solution significantly increases the number of applications and services for which cNODE systems could be used. The full potential of the cNODE Mantis as ‘a second set of eyes’ in this respect is easily realised. The live video it streams is transmitted to a receiver installed either on the ROV’s TMS (Tether Management System) or on the vessel itself, at ranges of up to 500m. As the wireless video transfer works on a high-speed acoustics link it will function in both murky and clear water conditions and is unaffected by background light. With a bit-rate of up to 70 kbit/s, it allows for the transfer of live video with a typical quality of 420 x 380p at four frames per second.Uplink video streamingStream video, 420x480, 4 frames per secondComposite video inputEhternet outputInterleaves sensor dataDemonstrated range: 250m (limited by test setup/water depth)Estimated range: 500mDownlink ControlControl data or vehicle and cameraEstimated range: 500mData rate: 25kb/s \\n Stream video, 420x480, 4 frames per second\\nComposite video input\\nEhternet output\\nInterleaves sensor data\\nDemonstrated range: 250m (limited by test setup/water depth)\\nEstimated range: 500m\\nControl data or vehicle and camera\\nEstimated range: 500m\\nData rate: 25kb/s', 'https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/Acoustics-Positioning-and-Communication/acoustic-positioning-systems/pap-micropap-compact-acoustic-positioning-system/': \"µPAP transducers. µPAP is a compact acoustic positioning system for operation from surface vessel to track ROV's, tow fish, divers and other subsea targets.The system can be used with all KONGSBERG manufactured transponders for depths down to 4000 meters.A built in motion sensor in the µPAP transducer compensates for vessel roll and pitch movements.
