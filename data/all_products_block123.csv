1) Accuracy is in X and Y direction
2) Range capability is depending on line of sight, transponder's transmit power setting, vessel's acoustic system and influence of ambient noise and ray bending.
3) Operational coverage defines the sector where acoustic positioning and communications are operational. Main Coverage is the sector where maximum range and angular accuracy can be achieved. Outside the main coverage range and elevation angular accuracy are reduced, therefore a depth input for aiding is recommended
