The AIS 300S utilises the AIS technology beyond standard AIS functionality and is a powerful tool for different maritime operations. It can be configured to output a set of virtual AIS objects that can describe an area of operation, dynamic and/or static. Such an area of operation can be the rectangle constituting the streamer area behind a seismic vessel or a safety area around an offshore operation. The implementation is based on relevant international standards.""}","{""heading"": ""AIS for Special Operations"", ""text"": ""In some operations the activity is below the surface, such as for operations involving remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV) or seismic streamer operations. This constitutes an operational problem and there are risks related to some main issues: vessels coming in conflict with the operation and damage to vessels or equipment because of this, damage to underwater equipment in the operation area, and unwanted interference with the maritime operation and financial loss because of delays and mission abort. Even if all vessels are carrying standard AIS Class A equipment, AIS capabilities can be used to better support navigation in areas where special operations are taking place. Complex operations such as coordinated lifting or towing activity are also target applications for AIS 300S. An effective way to warn vessels in the Area Of Responsibility (AOR) about actual movements below the surface is by use of AIS.""}","{""heading"": ""Advanced Tracking and Communication"", ""text"": ""The AIS 300S is delivered with a feature for transmission of automatic notifications. Area filters can be applied to the AIS data stream. If a vessel enters the area, an addressed user configurable text message will be transmitted to the vessel. The message can contain information about the on-going operation. The intention is to reduce the amount of VHF voice communication and release more time for the operators to focus on the operation. Information, such as the position of submerged objects, can be transferred to the AIS system and embedded in the AIS message used for virtual AIS transmission.

With its 4-channel standard WBT, the EA440 operates across a range of 10 kHz to 500 kHz, transmitting and receiving data simultaneously. This feature enables versatility in applications and redundancy setup. Besides, the EA440 ensures high-quality signal and range resolution through its wide band frequency sweep and advanced signal processing.""}","{""heading"": ""MULTIPLE FREQUENCIES AVAILABLE"", ""text"": ""Up to eight transceiver channels can be operated simultaneously from the EA440. For improved performance, the transceivers are installed close to the transducers and linked to the combined display and processor unit with a single Ethernet cable.

The third step is to define the duration of the deployment which can be divided into several phases. Usually, it's sufficient to use only one single phase. The last step in the mission planning is to put the ping groups you defined into ensembles. You can choose if the ensembles shall be repeated for a fixed number of iterations or for as many times as possible within the time span you choose.

It utilizes the same field-proven transducers as the EM 122, making it easy to upgrade. Care has been taken to design a highly, modular and flexible solution with compact electronics for easier and faster installation. Due to a flexible transducer design, the system can be tailored to almost any required size.

Near field beam focus is applied in real time, both during transmission and reception.

The successor to the EM 122, the EM 124’s broad range of functionality supports simultaneous collection of multiple data types, saving time in the planning, execution and analysis phase. A low noise echo sounder, EM 124 delivers superior data that requires minimal post-processing.""}","{""heading"": ""Modular and Flexible Design"", ""text"": ""The EM 124 consist of new state-of-the-art electronics and separate transmit and receive transducers in a Mills Cross configuration. It utilizes the same field-proven transducers as the EM 122, making it easy to upgrade. Care has been taken to design a highly, modular and flexible solution with compact electronics for easier and faster installation. Due to a flexible transducer design, the system can be tailored to almost any required size. The largest standard size, 0.5 x 1 degrees, gives the ultimate system performance in terms of resolution and range, while a smaller 4 x 4 degrees solution allowing full ocean depth surveys even on smaller vessels.""}","{""heading"": ""Clean and High Resolution Data"", ""text"": ""Due to the sector transmission technique, the system produces a strong dampening of multi-bounce interference from false echo, resulting in significantly cleaner data. Near field beam focus is applied in real time, both during transmission and reception. Due to sector transmission the focal point will be individual for each sector, resulting in a much sharper transmit beam over the entire swath. On reception, the focus is done dynamically for each beam. The result is a much higher resolution representation of the seabed.""}","{""heading"": ""Full Seabed Coverage"", ""text"": ""The transmit fan is divided into up to 16 individual sectors in dual swath mode. This allows for unique control of the transmit fan, enabling active stabilization in real time to correct for any yaw and pitch movement of the vessel, while roll stabilization is applied on the receiving beams. The result is a stabilized system for full ensonification of the seabed with equally distributed footprints, even in bad weather conditions, leaving no gaps or holes in the mapped area. All beams are maintained and automatically adjusted according to achievable coverage or operator defined limits. Up to 1600 individual beams are available in dual swath mode.

The enhanced EM 2040P MKII is delivered with three essential components: A sonar head, a processing unit, and a workstation. The three-sector broadband multibeam echo sounder, now offered from 200 to 700 kHz, allows operators to select the best operating frequency for varied applications, such as 300 kHz for near bottom, 200 kHz for deeper waters, and 400-700 kHz for very high resolution inspection.""}","{""heading"": ""Versatility and High-Definition Performance"", ""text"": ""The EM 2040P MKII excels in versatility, enabling the operator to achieve Multi Frequency Backscatter of up to five frequencies in a single pass by alternating between frequency modes per ping. The same functionality supports switching between a full swath mode and a high resolution mode which ensures full coverage and ultra high resolution over targeted areas. With the capability of working effectively with very short pulse lengths and a raw range resolution of 10.5 mm, this system redefines high-definition seabed mapping.""}","{""heading"": ""Components"", ""text"": ""The basic EM 2040P MKII has three components:
A sonar head, a processing unit and a workstation.
The sonar head has bumpers in the corners of the face of the transducer to protect it if it is placed on deck, and it has carrying handles on the sides. The EM 2040P MKII can be delivered with the standard processing unit or a IP67 rated (24 VDC) portable processing unit. 

As an option the EM 2040P MKII can be delivered with the dual swath capability, allowing a sufficient sounding density to meet survey coverage standards along track while maintaining a high vessel speed. 
For real-time motion stabilization and compensation, data input from a motion sensor, heading and a positioning system is required. A sound speed profile of the water column is also required for real-time correction. Sound speed at the transducer depth is now available fully integrated in the sonar head with AML’s latest generation SVT sensor, made of monolithic titanium, providing high accuracy and easy re-calibration in a rugged package.""}","[{""Title"": ""Operational Specifications"", ""Specifications"": [{""Title"": ""Frequency range"", ""Value"": ""200 to 700 kHz""}, {""Title"": ""Max ping rate"", ""Value"": ""50 Hz""}, {""Title"": ""Swath coverage sector"", ""Value"": ""Up to 170°""}]}, {""Title"": ""Physical Specifications"", ""Specifications"": [{""Title"": ""Depth Rating"", ""Value"": ""30 metres""}]}, {""Title"": ""Beam Characteristics"", ""Specifications"": [{""Title"": ""Beam patterns"", ""Value"": ""Equiangular, equidistant, high density and ultra high density""}, {""Title"": ""No. of beams per ping"", ""Value"": ""512 (single swath) / 1024 (dual swath)""}]}, {""Title"": ""Stabilisation Specifications"", ""Specifications"": [{""Title"": ""Roll stabilised beams"", ""Value"": ""± 15°""}, {""Title"": ""Pitch stabilised beams"", ""Value"": ""± 10°""}, {""Title"": ""Yaw stabilised beams"", ""Value"": ""± 10°""}]}]","Ultra-high resolution#

EM 712 USV is reinvigorated for USVs with features such as transmit and receive nearfield focusing, seabed image, dual swath, modular design, water column display, water column logging, and extra detections, with a choice of beamwidths depending on the transducer configuration.""}","{""heading"": ""Innovative Acoustic Principles"", ""text"": ""The EM 712 operates at a frequency range of 40 to 100 kHz. The system excels due to its innovative design, where the transmit fan is divided into three individual sectors that aid in maximizing range capability and suppressing interference from strong bottom echoes. This results in strong reflectors outside the current TX sector receiving twice the sidelobe suppression on TX and RX in comparison to sounders with only one wide TX sector. These sectors are transmitted sequentially within each ping, utilizing distinct frequencies or waveforms. Moreover, the EM 712S and EM 712RD use CW pulses, while the full performance version, EM 712, supports longer, compressible waveforms (FM sweep).""}","{""heading"": ""Stabilized and Focused Beam Technology"", ""text"": ""Fully stabilized and focused beams are implemented where the system applies beam focusing to both transmit and receive beams to achieve maximum resolution, even within the acoustic near-field of the antenna. There is dynamic focusing on all receive beams, and roll, pitch and yaw stabilization is applied in real time. The active elements of the EM 712 transducers are based upon composite ceramics, offering advantages like increased bandwidth and tighter performance tolerances. The electronics system of the EM 712 involves a true wideband design with customizable components and circuitry that enable it to support a wide range of frequencies and pulse forms.""}","[

The system can be aided from acoustic positioning systems, doppler velocity and pressure sensors. The integrated solution designed for operation on an AUV, ROV, towed fish and any other subsea vehicle down to 7000 meters water depth, consists of an inertial measurement unit, doppler velocity log and onboard navigation processing. The HAIN unit receives the subsea vehicle position aid from an SSBL system on a surface vessel or a sparse LBL system on the subsea vehicle. In addition, to further improve position accuracy, the co-located DVL and pressure sensor 7000m rated can be used as aids to the inertial solution.""}","{""heading"": ""Application Potential"", ""text"": ""HAIN Subsea 7000 is designed to provide fast precise position updates with full attitude output for deep sea mining, cable trenching, ROV survey, AUV navigation and towed fish tracking. Seamless compatibility with HiPAP ensures the HAIN Subsea 7000's on board processor interfaces easily without the need for an additional topside computer. The new user-friendly HAIN interface is now accessible on HiPAP and uPAPAPOS operator stations.""}","{""heading"": ""Enhanced Positioning Aids"", ""text"": ""Position aiding to HAIN can be provided by an SSBL system or via Sparse LBL ranges. A cPAPLBL Transceiver can be interfaced to the HAIN directly and measures LBL ranges to cNODE transponders on known seabed reference points. Fast absolute position calibration of seabed reference transponders is possible with an ROV adaptive box-in, with this technique the ROV is positioned with SSBL and HAIN, flying a circle around the seabed transponder while measuring LBL ranges. Relative position accuracy can be further improved with baseline measurements between the seabed transponders.""}",,"[
