Domed Scanning Sonar,,Key Features: - Patented acoustic lens design - Maintains beam focus through operational temperature and depth changes - Significantly improves sonar performance - Available in a 4000M depth-rated version,"Domed Sonar Background: In the 1990s, designers enclosed the transducer in an oil-filled dome to provide mechanical protection and eliminate flooding due to O-ring failure on the traditional exposed transducer shaft. While the oil-filled dome solved the O-ring flooding failures, it introduced beam defocusing in two conditions, warm & shallow and cold & deep. Our engineers solved this problem by designing a patented acoustic lens that maintains beam focus through operational temperature and depth changes, significantly improving sonar performance and resulting in images that are much sharper. Clariscan is currently available in a 4000M depth-rated version. Applications: Clariscan is suitable for obstacle avoidance, pipeline survey, target detection, and underwater construction support. Data Comparison: Deep water testing in the Gulf of Mexico clearly showed the difference in image quality between the Clariscan sonar head and the standard domed sonar with composite transducer.",I don't know,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/marine-robotics/underwater-vehicle-instruments/single-beam-scanning-sonars/domed-scanning-sonar/,Surveillance & monitoring

With this release, Kongsberg Maritime has upgraded the hardware and software to increase the swath and improve the data quality of our EM 2040 series. The system fulfils, and even surpasses, IHO-S44 Exclusive Order and the more stringent LINZ specification. The EM 2040 MKII is a modular system, fully prepared for upgrading to cater for more demanding applications. The basic system has four units: a transmit transducer, a receive transducer, a processing unit and a hydrographic workstation. The receiver is 0.5° and is delivered with a 0.25° or 0.5° transmitter(s). The transmit fan is divided into three sectors pinging simultaneously at separate frequencies ensuring a strong and beneficial dampening of multibounce interference. The system can effectively operate with very short pulse lengths, the shortest pulse being 14 microseconds giving a raw range resolution of 10.5 mm. The standard depth rating of the EM 2040 MKII transducers is 6000 m, making it ideal for operation on subsea vehicles such as ROVs or AUVs.","Frequency range, 200 to 700 kHz

However, this is really a measure of the pressure level of the output sound wave and is only directly applicable in the farfield. The intensity (power per unit area) of a sound wave can be found from the pressure level by the relation I = p2/ρc where ρ is the water density and c the speed of sound. The quantity ρc is the acoustic impedance of water and for sea water is nominally taken to be 1.5x106 kg/m2s. Thus, a pressure level in sea water of 1 μPa is nominally equal to an energy intensity of 0.667x10-18 W/m2, and a pressure level of for example 210 dB corresponds to an intensity of 667 W/m2. In the farfield the pressure level of a sound wave will fall off with the square of the distance, this because of spherical spreading of the wave, and the wave will be further attenuated due to absorption loss. In the next table the pressure levels at a set of fixed distances are given and also the range at which the pressure level is 180 dB re 1 μPa. Note that the figures are worst case, i.e. on-axis and with no defocusing. Note also that in this table absorption loss has been taken into account, but not in the former, using absorption coefficients of 0.2 dB/km at 4 kHz, 1 dB/km at 12 kHz, 6 dB/km at 30 kHz, 30 dB/km at 100 kHz, 50 dB/km at 200 kHz and 70 dB/km at 300 kHz.","System SL NF1 PL@NF1 NF2 PL@NF2 SBP 120/300/27/29 3° 230 0.8 m 209 138 m 187 SBP System SL, SBP System NF1, SBP PL@NF1, SBP NF2, SBP PL@NF2, EM 122/124 0.5° 245 3.5 m 207 1749 m 180 EM 120/122/124 1° 242 3.5 m 210 438 m 189 EM 120/122/124 2° 236 3.5 m 210 110 m 195 EM 302 /304 MKI and MKII 0.5° 241 1.3 m 211 704 m 184 EM 300/302/304 MKI and MKII 1° 237 1.3 m 213 175 m 192 EM 300/302/304 MKI and MKII 2° 231 1.3 m 213 43 m 198 EM 710/712 0.5° 232 0.3 m 213 246 m 184 EM 710/712 1° 228 0.3 m 215 61 m 192 EM 710/712 2° 222 0.3 m 215 15 m 198 EM 3002 (1.5°) 216 0.01 m 227 8 m 198 EM 2040 (0.5°) 217 0.002 m 225 82 m 179 EM 2040 (1.0°) 211 0.002 m 225 20 m 185 EM 2040C (1.3°) 205 0.0005 m 227 11 m 183 Single Beam System SL TP BW TR RS 12Khz 12-16/60 18+1 Element 221,8 2000 16 171 -168,5 12Khz 12-16/60 1 Wide Element 197,8 100 60 142 -168,5 15Khz (15-17 Airmar) 228,4 4000 17 165 -175 18Khz (18/11) 225,8 2000 11 ±2 176 ±2 -168 ±2 38Khz (38/7) 230,1 2000 7 182,5 ±2 -170,5 ±2 38Khz (38/9) 225,6 1500 9 177 -171 38/200Khz (Combi W) 222,8 400 -184 / /220,7 /250 31 164 /155 -197 38/200Khz (Combi C and D) 218,8 / 13/21 and -178 / and D) 226,3 1000 7 170 /178 -185 50Khz (50/7) 228,8 2000 7 177,5 -173 50Khz (50/18) 214,8 500 18 ±3 207 ±2 -181 ±2 50/200 Khz (Combi C and D) 221 / 10/16 and -179 / and D) 227 1000 7 172 / 178 -185 120Khz (120-25) 227,8 1000 10 ±2 176,5 ±2 -183 ±2 120Khz (SideScan) 223,3 1000 1,9/55 ? ? 200Khz (200 7F) 226,3 1000 7 ±1 180 ±2 -185 ±2 200Khz (200 7G) 215 ±2 re 1 µpa per 226,3 1000 7 ±1 A -185 ±2 200Khz (200 9G) 221,6 500 9 175 ±2 -169 ±2 200Khz (200 28E) 228 1500 7 ±1 180 ±2 -185 ±2 200Khz (200-35E) 235,8 2000 3 ±0.5 186,5 -177 200Khz (Side Scan) 226,8 1000 0,5/49 182 ±2 -167 ±2 500Khz (500-3G) 231,4 500 3 186 ±2 -189 ±2 500Khz ( SideScan) 230,8 1000 0,35 / 60 179 -196",https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/multibeam-echo-sounders/em-2040-phs-portable-hydrographic-system-/,"Seafloor mapping, Geophysical survey"

With the release of the EM 2040 MKII series Kongsberg Maritime has upgraded the hardware and software to increase the swath and improve the data quality of our EM 2040 series. The system fulfils, and even surpasses, IHO-S44 Exclusive with one sonar head, allowing coverage of 5.5 times water depth. For a dual transducer system, 200° angular coverage or 10 times the water depth is achieved on a flat bottom. The operating frequency range is from 200 to 400 kHz with frequency selection in steps of 10 kHz. The operator can on the fly choose the best operating frequency for the application: 300 kHz for near bottom, 200 kHz for deeper waters and 400 or 700 kHz for very high resolution inspection. By alternating between the frequency modes per ping, the system is capable of providing the operator with Multi Frequency Backscatter of up to 5 frequencies in a single pass. The same functionality allows the system to alternate between a full swath mode and a high resolution mode providing full coverage while maintaining ultra high resolution over a target. The maximum depth range for a dual head system in cold ocean water is 520 m at 200 kHz with a swath width up to 700 m. Due to the large operating bandwidth, the system has an output sample rate up to 60 kHz. The system can effectively operate with very short pulse lengths. The shortest pulse is 14 microseconds, which gives a raw range resolution (ct/2) of 10.5 mm.

It can reduce the need for onboard visits by KONGSBERG Service personnel, saving both time and cost while reducing downtime due to shorter response time on support requests. Kongsberg Remote Services are built on a common technology platform for KONGSBERG products. When installed on board Remote Services can support several KONGSBERG products on the same platform. The system is designed to address the challenges of establishing a secure and reliable remote session to the vessel HiPAP system via satellite communications. KONGSBERG's global secure network is developed in-house and all communications are authenticated and encrypted by a Kongsberg Maritime controlled PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) regime. If a user requires support, the operator simply needs to request to press the 'Remote support' button on the HiPAP Operator Station (APOS). The request will then be handled by a KONGSBERG certified engineer in a KONGSBERG Support center. The engineer can view the operator's screen and assist via telephone or text chat through remote services. Initially, the on board user cannot operate the system during the support session, only view the screen onboard. The next level in the process is to enable the KONGSBERG support engineer to operate the system, check parameters and other status information. Execution of specific tasks can be carried out. If remote operation of the system shall be carried out, risk assessment and remote safe job analysis will have been completed by the customer and KONGSBERG in advance. Remote operation is only done by a certified KONGSBERG engineer after onboard personnel have initiated and approved the session and the time duration is agreed.",I don't know,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/Acoustics-Positioning-and-Communication/acoustic-positioning-systems/hipap-models/remote-services-for-hipap-systems/,Underwater navigation & positioning

Cable length: 20 metres
Weight (in air, with cable): 13.3 kg","The Simrad CP200-5C transducer housing contains three separate transducers set up to measure water velocity, and one single-beam transducer for traditional fish-finding. Due to its high operating frequency the CP200-5C provides accurate measurements and detailed echograms. The transducer is normally mounted flush with the hull plating. A clamping frame is used to secure the transducer body to a mounting frame. The mounting frame is welded to the bottom plate. The transducer cable penetrates the hull using a cable gland. The cable gland consists of a bushing, rubber gasket, washers and a packing nipple. The transducer can also be flush mounted at the bottom of a blister or a drop keel. The CP200-5C transducer is connected to an echo sounder system. For maximum measurement accuracy, we strongly recommend that you connect a motion reference unit (MRU) to the echo sounder system. If a motion reference unit (MRU) is not available, use a motion sensor to measure roll and pitch. As a minimum solution, a global positioning system (GPS) can be used. To obtain precision data that are both detailed and correct, it is necessary to align the transducer and measure its location and offset in relation to the vessel's coordinate system.

Simrad PX Configurator,," - The PX Configurator allows configuration of catch monitoring sensors for use with software other than TV80, and can also be used for trawl door calibration - It provides the ability to change parameters of various catch monitoring sensors, including PX Flow, PX TrawlEye, PX Universal, PX MultiCatch, PX MultiSensor Mk1, PX MultiSensor Mk2, and PxPos - The user interface comprises several “stand-alone” dialog boxes allowing the configuration of different types of sensors","The PX Configurator is a tool developed mainly to configure the catch monitoring sensors that are going to be read by a software different from the TV80 Software, for example the PI50 Software. The PX Configurator can also be used to calibrate the trawl doors on a remote place where there is no other calibration utility available, like for example the TV80. Catch monitoring sensors are delivered from Simrad readily set up with common default settings. In some cases, you may find that the default parameters do not suit your operational needs. This is for example if you have more than one sensor of any given type. The decision to configure a sensor is one you must make depending on how many sensors you use, and how many of these are identical. Dedicated dialog boxes are provided to configure the new sensor. Note: The PX Configurator only allows you to configure PX sensors. If you wish to use older sensors (not PX family), these must be configured using their dedicated applications before putting them to use. With the PX Configurator, you can configure and change the parameters of the following catch monitoring sensors: PX Flow, PX TrawlEye, PX Universal, PX MultiCatch, PX MultiSensor Mk1, PX MultiSensor Mk2, and PxPos. The user interface comprises several “stand-alone” dialog boxes. Depending on the type of sensor connected, different dialog boxes with dedicated parameters will be used to perform the configuration itself. The configurator parameters allow you to set up which measurements the sensor shall make and which communication channels it shall use for these measurements. Who can program catch monitoring sensors: Sensor configuration is normally performed by authorized Simrad technicians. However, individuals with basic computer skills and access to the necessary equipment should not find it difficult. Necessary tools and equipment: If you purchase a computer locally, make sure that the chosen model meets the functional and technical requirements. The computer must be able to facilitate the various interface requirements made by the PX Configurator, and you may need to add extra Ethernet and serial adapters.

Transmit modes offering TX tilting and TX beam width variation available when narrow beams are unfavourable.","The SBP 27 is the next generation narrow beam, multibeam sub-bottom profiler, and is the successor of the SBP 120 and SBP 300. The system has new and improved technology, wider bandwidth 2 – 9 kHz and accordingly improved range resolution.

This is obtained by one linear transmitter array mounted along the vessel keel, and one linear hydrophone array (shared system. For the three-degree transmitter, the frequency with the EM 122/302) mounted orthogonal to the keel. The footprint of the transmitter array is wide acrosstrack between 3.5 kHz and 6.5 kHz. Because the transmit beam is wide acrosstrack and all hydrophones are sampled individually, the SBP 27 can make a fan of narrow beams acrosstrack per ping. The array geometry of the SBP 27 is the same as that used by the EM multibeam echo sounders. For reception, it uses the wideband receive antenna of the EM system. With much narrower beam widths than conventional sub-bottom profilers, the SBP 27 provides superior specular return to backscatter ratio and thereby. The benefits of using large arrays are: multibeam capability of the SBP 27 is useful for increasing source level, finding the specular return(s) in rough terrain, resolving lateral specular returns in rough terrain, detecting buried objects, and obtaining information about the sloping angle of sediments.","Operating frequency: 2 to 9 kHz.

 - Ability to generate wider beams when desired
 - Swath of beams per ping for across track slope robustness and buried object detection
 - Transmit modes for unfavorable narrow beam conditions: cyclic variation of beam width and alongtrack beam tilt
 - Typically operated in parallel with the EM system, synchronized or unsynchronized
 - Burst and multi-pulse modes for high ping rate in deep water","The SBP 29 is a next-generation narrow beam sub-bottom profiler and the successor of the SBP 120 and SPB 300. It features new and improved technology with wider bandwidth 2 – 9 kHz and enhanced range resolution. Its primary application is for sub-bottom imaging of sediment layers and buried objects, with electronically stabilized beams for roll and pitch, and heave compensation. The system has the capability to store data as raw or in SEG-Y format. The SBP 29 offers advantages when encountering sloping sediments compared to other systems. It provides superior specular return to backscatter ratio and improved penetration with less cluttered imaging due to its narrow beam widths. It also allows for wider beams operation when necessary, and offers two transmit modes to address sloping sediments as well as burst and multi-pulse modes for high ping rates in deep water.","Operating frequency: 2 to 9 kHz

Synthetic Aperture Sonar,, -Much higher resolution compared to conventional sonars. -Wideband SAS sonar with frequency range of 70-100kHz. -4 cm resolution along track and across. -Reverberation suppression for reduced influence of seabed and sea surface reverberation. -Multi-aspect imaging facilitated by the small element size. -High resolution interferometric processing from SAS data. -Highly accurate measurement of AUV's displacement (or velocity) in all three dimensions. -FOCUS Synthetic Aperture Sonar: delivered post-processing toolbox.,"Synthetic aperture sonars combine a number of acoustic pings to form an image with much higher resolution than conventional sonars, typically 10 times higher. HISAS is a wideband SAS sonar with frequency range of 70-100kHz, capable of producing ultra high resolution acoustic images as well as co-registered bathymetry. The sonar is tightly integrated with the INS navigation and motion sensing platform of the HUGIN AUV, and makes use of modern signal processing such as DPCA (Displaced Phase Centre Analysis) to process the raw data into images. The synthetic aperture sonar prototype has recently been tested with success at sea outside Horten, Norway, with signal processing done by Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI). The image above is from this test and shows a sunken wreck standing upright on the bottom. It has a resolution of about 4 cm both along track and across, each acoustic beam being processed from 40 consecutive pings. The azimuth (along-track) resolution of a sonar can be computed as the ratio between the acoustic wavelength and the length of the array. For typical side scan sonars, this ratio is of the order 1:60-1:400 (meaning a resolution of 1 m at 60 and 400 m range, respectively). A longer array will increase this ratio, but fitting such a long array is not always possible or practical on most underwater vehicles. Operation at a higher frequency will increase the ratio, but will at the same time limit the achievable range due to higher absorption. The multi-element transmit array and the programmable transmit waveform generator allows both beam direction and beam coverage to be varied to reduce influence of seabed and sea surface reverberation. The small (in wavelengths) element size gives this sensor a wide field of view, facilitating the use of multi-aspect imaging. HISAS 1030 has two full-length receive arrays on each side of the AUV. They are used to form two SAS images of the same scene with slightly different geometry. This adds considerable robustness to the system, but it also allows very high resolution interferometric processing from SAS data. HISAS can optionally provide a highly accurate measurement of an AUV's displacement (or velocity) in all three dimensions. FOCUS is a complete SAS post-processing toolbox, delivered with HISAS 1030. The output products can be divided into four categories.",I don't know,https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/ocean-science/mapping-systems/sonars/SAS/,Seafloor mapping
