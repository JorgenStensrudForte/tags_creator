However, this is really a measure of the pressure level of the output sound wave and is only directly applicable in the farfield. The intensity (power per unit area) of a sound wave can be found from the pressure level by the relation I = p2/ρc where ρ is the water density and c the speed of sound. The quantity ρc is the acoustic impedance of water and for sea water is nominally taken to be 1.5x106 kg/m2s. Thus, a pressure level in sea water of 1 μPa is nominally equal to an energy intensity of 0.667x10-18 W/m2, and a pressure level of for example 210 dB corresponds to an intensity of 667 W/m2. In the farfield the pressure level of a sound wave will fall off with the square of the distance, this because of spherical spreading of the wave, and the wave will be further attenuated due to absorption loss. In the next table the pressure levels at a set of fixed distances are given and also the range at which the pressure level is 180 dB re 1 μPa. Note that the figures are worst case, i.e. on-axis and with no defocusing. Note also that in this table absorption loss has been taken into account, but not in the former, using absorption coefficients of 0.2 dB/km at 4 kHz, 1 dB/km at 12 kHz, 6 dB/km at 30 kHz, 30 dB/km at 100 kHz, 50 dB/km at 200 kHz and 70 dB/km at 300 kHz.", - Source level in dB relative to 1 μPa at a distance of 1 m from the transmit transducer. - Pressure level of the output sound wave is directly applicable in the farfield. - Intensity of a sound wave can be found from the pressure level by the relation I = p2/ρc. - Acoustic impedance of water for sea water is nominally taken to be 1.5x106 kg/m2s. - Pressure level in sea water of 1 μPa is nominally equal to an energy intensity of 0.667x10-18 W/m2. - Pressure levels at a set of fixed distances and the range at which the pressure level is 180 dB re 1 μPa.,"System SL NF1 PL@NF1 NF2 PL@NF2 SBP 120/300/27/29 3° 230 0.8 m 209 138 m 187 SBP System SL, SBP System NF1, SBP PL@NF1, SBP NF2, SBP PL@NF2, EM 122/124 0.5° 245 3.5 m 207 1749 m 180 EM 120/122/124 1° 242 3.5 m 210 438 m 189 EM 120/122/124 2° 236 3.5 m 210 110 m 195 EM 302 /304 MKI and MKII 0.5° 241 1.3 m 211 704 m 184 EM 300/302/304 MKI and MKII 1° 237 1.3 m 213 175 m 192 EM 300/302/304 MKI and MKII 2° 231 1.3 m 213 43 m 198 EM 710/712 0.5° 232 0.3 m 213 246 m 184 EM 710/712 1° 228 0.3 m 215 61 m 192 EM 710/712 2° 222 0.3 m 215 15 m 198 EM 3002 (1.5°) 216 0.01 m 227 8 m 198 EM 2040 (0.5°) 217 0.002 m 225 82 m 179 EM 2040 (1.0°) 211 0.002 m 225 20 m 185 EM 2040C (1.3°) 205 0.0005 m 227 11 m 183 Single Beam System SL TP BW TR RS 12Khz 12-16/60 18+1 Element 221,8 2000 16 171 -168,5 12Khz 12-16/60 1 Wide Element 197,8 100 60 142 -168,5 15Khz (15-17 Airmar) 228,4 4000 17 165 -175 18Khz (18/11) 225,8 2000 11 ±2 176 ±2 -168 ±2 38Khz (38/7) 230,1 2000 7 182,5 ±2 -170,5 ±2 38Khz (38/9) 225,6 1500 9 177 -171 38/200Khz (Combi W) 222,8 400 -184 / /220,7 /250 31 164 /155 -197 38/200Khz (Combi C and D) 218,8 / 13/21 and -178 / and D) 226,3 1000 7 170 /178 -185 50Khz (50/7) 228,8 2000 7 177,5 -173 50Khz (50/18) 214,8 500 18 ±3 207 ±2 -181 ±2 50/200 Khz (Combi C and D) 221 / 10/16 and -179 / and D) 227 1000 7 172 / 178 -185 120Khz (120-25) 227,8 1000 10 ±2 176,5 ±2 -183 ±2 120Khz (SideScan) 223,3 1000 1,9/55 ? ? 200Khz (200 7F) 226,3 1000 7 ±1 180 ±2 -185 ±2 200Khz (200 7G) 215 ±2 re 1 µpa per 226,3 1000 7 ±1 A -185 ±2 200Khz (200 9G) 221,6 500 9 175 ±2 -169 ±2 200Khz (200 28E) 228 1500 7 ±1 180 ±2 -185 ±2 200Khz (200-35E) 235,8 2000 3 ±0.5 186,5 -177 200Khz (Side Scan) 226,8 1000 0,5/49 182 ±2 -167 ±2 500Khz (500-3G) 231,4 500 3 186 ±2 -189 ±2 500Khz ( SideScan) 230,8 1000 0,35 / 60 179 -196"

It is an ideal tool for any high resolution mapping and inspection application. With the release of the EM 2040 MKII series Kongsberg Maritime has upgraded the hardware and software to increase the swath and improve the data quality of our EM 2040 series. The system fulfils, and even surpasses, IHO-S44 Exclusive with one sonar head, allowing coverage of 5.5 times water depth. For a dual transducer system, 200° angular coverage or 10 times the water depth is achieved on a flat bottom. The operating frequency range is from 200 to 400 kHz with frequency selection in steps of 10 kHz. The operator can on the fly choose the best operating frequency for the application: 300 kHz for near bottom, 200 kHz for deeper waters and 400 or 700 kHz for very high resolution inspection. By alternating between the frequency modes per ping, the system is capable of providing the operator with Multi Frequency Backscatter of up to 5 frequencies in a single pass. The same functionality allows the system to alternate between a full swath mode and a high resolution mode providing full coverage while maintaining ultra high resolution over a target. The maximum depth range for a dual head system in cold ocean water is 520 m at 200 kHz with a swath width up to 700 m. Due to the large operating bandwidth, the system has an output sample rate up to 60 kHz. The system can effectively operate with very short pulse lengths. The shortest pulse is 14 microseconds, which gives a raw range resolution (ct/2) of 10.5 mm. The EM 2040C is also available in a 1500m depth rated version with a 130° swath for ROV or AUV operations.","  - 200-400 kHz wide frequency range

The system has new and improved technology, wider bandwidth 2 – 9 kHz and accordingly improved range resolution. The SBP 27 has significantly reduced beam widths improved penetration and less cluttered imaging compared to conventional sub-bottom profilers. This is obtained by one linear transmitter array mounted along the vessel keel, and one linear hydrophone array (shared system. For the three-degree transmitter, the frequency with the EM 122/302) mounted orthogonal to the keel. The footprint of the transmitter array is wide acrosstrack between 3.5 kHz and 6.5 kHz. Because the transmit beam is wide acrosstrack and all hydrophones are sampled individually, the SBP 27 can make a fan of narrow beams acrosstrack per ping. The array geometry of the SBP 27 is the same as that used by the EM multibeam echo sounders. For reception, it uses the wideband receive antenna of the EM system. With much narrower beam widths than conventional sub-bottom profilers, the SBP 27 provides superior specular return to backscatter ratio and thereby. The benefits of using large arrays are: multibeam capability of the SBP 27 is useful for increasing source level, finding the specular return(s) in rough terrain, resolving lateral specular returns in rough terrain, detecting buried objects, and obtaining information about the sloping angle of sediments.","Operated in parallel with the EM 122 or EM 302 multibeam echo sounder.

Seismic cable control - eBird,"Communication solutions, Naval",https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/products/deck-machinery-and-cranes/deck-machinery/seismic-vessels/spread-management/eBird/,https://www.kongsberg.com/contentassets/fcb884f931154ae9a97e4f87c1bc39c8/datasheet_ebird.pdf,"The eBird offers effective lateral steering and depth control of seismic streamers with a minimum of additional acoustic noise. The uniform three wing solution and the built-in controller also provide full roll control capabilities. The eBird solution is built on an in-line body and three detachable wings. The snap-on/snap-off mechanism makes attachment/removal of wings an easy task during streamer deployment/retrieval and work-boat based maintenance. SmartWing makes it possible to maintain a very slim body to avoid acoustic noise induced by turbulence. eBird is designed to be a part of an outer control loop where all steering and control parameters can be accessed from the seismic vessel. The autonomous inner control loop ensures that eBird will maintain the correct depth and roll angle even if communication through the streamer is interrupted. Each wing is equipped with a battery that is continuously maintenance charged during normal operation. In case of streamer power failure, wing batteries will work as back-up power sources enabling continued operation for more than one week. The eBird technology is protected by several international patents.","• In-line titanium body with 3 detachable wings
