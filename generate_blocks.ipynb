For a dual transducer system, 200° angular coverage or 10 times the water depth is achieved on a flat bottom. The operating frequency range is from 200 to 400 kHz with frequency selection in steps of 10 kHz. The operator can on the fly choose the best operating frequency for the application: 300 kHz for near bottom, 200 kHz for deeper waters and 400 or 700 kHz for very high resolution inspection. 700 kHz inspection mode provides the highest resolution available contained within a narrow 30° swath.'}\n",

The same functionality allows the system to alternate between a full swath mode and a high resolution mode providing full coverage while maintaining ultra high resolution over a target. By utilizing both CW and FM chirp pulses, the system can achieve long range capability and still maintain a high resolution. The maximum depth range for a dual head system in cold ocean water is 520 m at 200 kHz with a swath width up to 700 m.'}\n",

      "{'heading': 'Introduction', 'text': 'The RADius 800X transponder is a part of the short-distance relative positioning system RADius, developed for use in applications where the need for a robust and highly accurate relative positioning system is crucial. The system comprises an interrogator, installed on a vessel, operating in the 5.5 GHz band and transponders which are deployed on the target. The RADius 800X has an operating range of up to 1000 metres, and is suitable for fixed installations on typical a platform or an FPSO.'}\n",
      "{'heading': 'Main Components', 'text': 'The main parts of the RADius 800X transponder equipment are: The transponder consisting of the transponderelectronic unit located behind a plastic cover (cover transparent to radio frequency used - 5.5 to 5.6 GHz), and the connection box with terminals for the DC voltage cable and a DIP switch for setting the Transponder Identification code. The Field Power Unit, with the intrinsically safe DC/DC PSD1004 power supply, located in the proximity of the transponder equipment. The safe area equipment: The Phoenix QUINT AC/DC power supply and the PSD1001C DC/DC barrier and power supply.'}\n",
      "{'heading': 'ATEX Certification and Unique ID', 'text': 'ATEX certification ATEX category 2 G product, gas group II B, temperature class T4, specified ambient temperature rating -20 °C to +60 °C. Unique ID The transponders are coded with unique IDs ensuring reliable identification and tracking of vessels in demanding environments. Several interrogators can approach the same transponders, ensuring multi-user capabilities. Up to five transponders can be tracked simultaneously by the interrogator.'}\n",
      "{'heading': 'Environmental Specifications', 'text': 'Transponder and Field Power Unit Operating humidity 20 to 100 % RH Storage humidity 20 to 70 % RH. RADius 800X transponder electronic unit with IP 66 ingress protection, and connection box IP 66 ingress protection. PSD1001C power supply is also IP 66 protected with an operating temperature range of -20 °C to +60 °C, and a storage temperature range of +5 °C to +40 °C.'}\n",

      "{'heading': 'Introduction', 'text': 'The RADius replacement battery pack for RADius 550X and RADius 700X transponders consists of a primary cell and a series resistor and is non-rechargeable. The battery pack is intrinsically safe. The cell with its infallible resistor is completely moulded inside a stainless steel container. For use and instructions of the battery pack, refer to the RADius 550X and RADius 700X Instruction Manuals.'}\n",
      "{'heading': 'Battery Longevity and Storage', 'text': 'The storage time of the RADius replacement battery for EX Transponders extends over 10 years at temperatures below +30 °C. Crafted with a Thionylchloride lithium battery, it endures a self-discharge rate of 1 to 2 % per year at room temperature. Recommended long-term storage conditions maintain a temperature below +30 °C, while short-term storage ranges from +5 °C to +40 °C.'}\n",
      "{'heading': 'Electrical and Mechanical Integrity', 'text': 'With a no-load voltage of Max 3.67 V and an infallible integrated current limiting resistor of 390 R, the battery ensures electrical reliability. It can deliver a maximum output current of 10.1 mA, with 39.4 mW as the available power from the pack. Comprised of a non-rechargeable 19 Ah capacity, the battery encased in stainless steel, with the cell and resistor moulded inside with 3M Scotch-Weld™ Epoxy Adhesives type DP190 Grey, assures mechanical robustness.'}\n",
      "{'heading': 'Certifications and Environmental Compliance', 'text': 'Accredited with ATEX, IECEx, and Inmetro certificates, the RADius battery pack meets high safety standards. Operational temperatures range from -25 to +60 °C and it possesses an Ingress protection rating of IP66, indicating a high level of protection against dust and water. Humidity resilience is strong, capable of withstanding 99 % non-condensing environments. Notably, while the bare battery cell is classified under UN 3090/3091 for transport, its secure encapsulation may exempt it from specific regulations.'}\n",
